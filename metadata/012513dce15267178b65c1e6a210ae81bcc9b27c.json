It contains the Federal grand jury handbook and the State grand jury handbook for Multnomah county. The author was told by the Federal court house in Portland, Oregon that he had to get written permission from the chief judge to even view a copy of the current grand jury handbook! As a result, he has published them after finally acquiring copies. Find out how the grand jury fell into disuse as judges, prosecutors and politicians systematically usurped power from the people. It is now time to take the law back into your own hands. 60 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:012513dce15267178b65c1e6a210ae81bcc9b27c","amp;dn":"Burgess-Take+The+Law+Into+Your+Own+Hands-Grand+Jury+in+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"012513dce15267178b65c1e6a210ae81bcc9b27c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,37,19,220,225,82,103,23,139,101,193,230,162,16,174,129,188,201,178,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
