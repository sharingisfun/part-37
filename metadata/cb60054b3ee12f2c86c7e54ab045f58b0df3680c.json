A world where vegetables (and fruits, too) are at the center of delicious mealsâ€”where crisp broccoli is the star of a dinner party and where the flavors and textures of bright, just-picked ingredients are a source of inspiration.\r\n \r\nAs much for carnivores as it is for vegetarians, Vegetronic is a playful and provocative examination of the potential of fresh produce. In this debut cookbook, Michelin-starred chef Alexis Gauthier introduces favorite ingredients from his kitchenâ€”from fragrant rose petals to artichokes, from ripe tomatoes to overripe strawberriesâ€”and explains how to highlight their flavors in visually arresting, vegetable-intensive (but not always vegetarian) preparations.\r\n \r\nAs arresting in their presentation as they are boldly flavored, these dishes can be as simple as peeling an orange or dicing a cucumber. Gauthier offers suggestions for coaxing something delicious from early- or late-in-season ingredients, like unyieldingly hard peaches or end-of-season fava beans and peas. Gauthier shows you how to harness eggplantâ€™s velvety texture for a sweet-and-sour bruschetta, or how to make a pan-fried head of broccoli dressed with whole-grain mustard into a worthy main course. Even when a dish gets an extra bump from bacon, chicken broth, or lamb jus, Gauthierâ€™s emphasis is always on the essential flavor of the vegetable or fruit that centers the dish as a whole.\r\n \r\nThese 120 diverse recipes focus on the potential of fresh fruits and vegetablesâ€”a salad of warm asparagus ribbons set over ricotta gnocchi and crunchy bacon; a scattering of crisp apples over shockingly pink beets; a chilled fava bean soup topped with a silky poached egg; a pumpkin risotto made even creamier with a dash of mascarpone. So whether youâ€™re a committed vegetarian or just an enthusiastic omnivore, Vegetronic will make you rethink the way you shop, cook, and eat all year long","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb60054b3ee12f2c86c7e54ab045f58b0df3680c","amp;dn":"Vegetronic+-+Extreme+Vegetable+Cooking+%282013%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb60054b3ee12f2c86c7e54ab045f58b0df3680c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,96,5,75,62,225,47,44,134,199,229,74,176,69,245,139,13,243,104,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
