His power and ways transcend our understanding. But if we are to grow in all He has for us, we need to tap into what the Holy Spirit has for us today. This book is filled with actual experiences from church history, and modern-day testimonies that are all grounded in the Word of God.\nOpen your heart to God as He delights in revealing Himself to you through spiritual experiences such as:\nEncountering Angels.\nDreams, Visions &amp; Miracles.\nNear-death Experiences.\nTesting the Spirits.\nInsights into Things to Come.\nHow to Keep Jesus Central.\nThe authors are convinced of the importance of operating in God's supernatural realm:\n\n&quot;Until authentic power displayed through God's prophets and healers infuses society, people will continue to turn toward the only source of power they see-occult and paranormal power displayed through television and in New Age circles.&quot;\n\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.\n\nSupport Amas school of technology. The only school of its kind in an entire 3rd world country that doesn't force poor people to pay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd89a0427ca1453b7c29019b9c85411f10a71e04","amp;dn":"Shifting+Shadows+of+Supernatural+Experiences%3A+A+Manual+to+Experi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd89a0427ca1453b7c29019b9c85411f10a71e04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,137,160,66,124,161,69,59,124,41,1,155,156,133,65,31,16,167,30,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
