It includes plans for the mechanics of the device. This article is good, however it has two flaws -\n\nFirstly for the electronics it tells you to refer to an EDM article in Popular Mechanics from March 1968. I have not been able to find this article online (at least not readable anyway) so if you have this article please post.\n\nThe second flaw is the edm itself, these type of machines work very well at getting rid of broken taps, however they are crude and can't really be used for much else (this is subjective of course).\n\nFor more info you can google light bulb edm - this will give info on the concept of the electronics - you can also see these light bulb edms working on youtube.\n\nGood luck.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6629909ea9f91ffa35d1275e276c1bb87d3c81d","amp;dn":"Vibrating+tap+buster+-+EDM+Electro+Discharge+Machine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6629909ea9f91ffa35d1275e276c1bb87d3c81d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,98,153,9,234,159,145,255,163,93,18,117,226,118,193,187,135,211,200,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
