It contains 17 chapters, with 18 contributors who are prominent humanists, professional artists, or scientists. It consists of three parts: Part I: Philosophy and History of Arts; Part II: Arts in Action; Part III: Understanding Arts. The book is aimed at both research scholars and lay people, and is unique in two important aspects.\n\nIt is probably the first and only book that academic professionals and practicing artists contribute to the same book, as equals, on the common theme of creating and understanding arts. (Artists here include Cristina Leiria whose huge Kun Iam (Goddess of Mercy) sculpture is an important landmark in Macau, and the famous movie director, Hark Tsui, who is publishing his first ever article on movie-making). Perhaps more importantly, a new understanding of the origin and nature of art is offered for the first time, which is more convincing than all the other hypotheses put forth in the last two thousand years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0de2605bcb29b642bc8553779f5759d7f462a4e5","amp;dn":"Arts_A+Science+Matter+-+Lam%2C+Lui.%2CBurguete%2C+Maria+-+%5BNon-Fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0de2605bcb29b642bc8553779f5759d7f462a4e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,226,96,91,203,41,182,66,188,133,83,119,159,87,89,215,244,98,164,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
