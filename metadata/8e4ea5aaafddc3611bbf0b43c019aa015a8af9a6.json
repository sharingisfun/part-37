The only thing wrong is that there should be more of them - only three tracks after 1969.  Essential for Elvis fans.  I think I posted these some years ago.  There are lots of new faces here since then so they're worth putting back on the tracker.  New scans for Box 4 as I couldn't find any and I don't think I ever got around to them.  Boxes 1-3 are the original scans I did way back when.  Completely new rip.\n\t \n  \t \t \t  \t \nSet List:\n\nVolume 08\n \t \t\n01 For The Millionth And The Last Time (take 1)\n02 For The Millionth And The Last Time (take 2)\n03 For The Millionth And The Last Time (takes 3 &amp; 4)\n04 For The Millionth And The Last Time (take 5)\n05 For The Millionth And The Last Time (takes 6 &amp; 7)\n06 For The Millionth And The Last Time (take 7)\n07 For The Millionth And The Last Time (take 8)\n08 For The Millionth And The Last Time (takes 9-11)\n09 Good Luck Charm (take 1)\n10 Good Luck Charm (takes 2-4)\n11 Anything That's Part Of You (take 1)\n12 Anything That's Part Of You (take 2)\n13 Anything That's Part Of You (take 3)\n14 Anything That's Part Of You (take 4 &amp; 5)\n15 Anything That's Part Of You (takes 6-8)\n16 Anything That's Part Of You (take 9)\n17 Anything That's Part Of You (take 10)\n18 I Met Her Today (take 1)\n19 I Met Her Today (takes 2-4)\n20 I Met Her Today (takes 5 &amp; 6)\n21 I Met Her Today (take 7)\n22 I Met Her Today (take 8)\n\nVolume 09\n\n01 I Met Her Today (takes 10-13)\n02 I Met Her Today (take 14)\n03 I Met Her Today (takes 15 &amp; 16)\n04 I Met Her Today (takes 17 &amp; 18)\n05 I Met Her Today (takes 19 &amp; 20)\n06 Night Rider (take 1)\n07 Night Rider (take 2)\n08 Night Rider (take 3)\n09 Echoes Of Love (take 1)\n10 Echoes Of Love (takes 2 &amp; 4)\n11 Echoes Of Love (takes 4-7)\n12 Echoes Of Love (take 8)\n13 Echoes Of Love (takes 9 &amp; 10)\n14 Please Don't Drag That String Around (take 1)\n15 Please Don't Drag That String Around (take 2)\n16 Please Don't Drag That String Around (takes 3-5)\n17 (Your're The) Devil In Disguise (takes 1-3)\n18 (Your're The) Devil In Disguise (takes 4-6)\n19 Never Ending (take 1)\n20 Never Ending (takes 2 &amp; 3)\n\nVolume 10\n\n01 What Now, What Next, Where To (take 1)\n02 Witchcraft (take 1)\n03 Witchcraft (take 2)\n04 Witchcraft (take 3)\n05 Finders Keepers, Loser Weepers (take 1)\n06 Finders Keepers, Loser Weepers (takes 2 &amp; 3)\n07 Love Me Tonight (take 1)\n08 Love Me Tonight (takes 2-4)\n09 Love Me Tonight (take 5)\n10 Love Me Tonight (takes 6-8)\n11 Memphis Tennessee (take 1)\n12 It's A Long Lonely Highway (take 1)\n13 Western Union (take 1)\n14 Western Union (takes 2 &amp; 3)\n15 Western Union (take 4)\n16 Slowly But Surely (take 1)\n17 Western Union (takes 2-4)\n18 Blue River (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n19 Ask Me (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n20 Ask Me (takes 3 &amp; 4)\n22 Ask Me (takes 5-8)\n\n\nVolume 11\n\n01 Run On (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n02 Run On (take 6)\n03 How Great Thou Art (take 2)\n04 Stand By Me (takes 2, 3 &amp; 4)\n05 Stand By Me (take 7)\n06 Stand By Me (takes 9 &amp; 10)\n07 Where No One Stands Alone (take 3, workparts takes 1-3)\n08 Down In The Alley\n09 Down In The Alley\n10 Love Letters\n11 Love Letters (take 2)\n12 So High (take 1)\n13 So High (take 3)\n14 Farther Along (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n15 By And By (takes 3 &amp; 4)\n16 By And By (take 9)\n17 Beyond The Reef\n18 Somebody Bigger Than You And I (takes 2, 4, 11)\n19 Somebody Bigger Than You And I (take 12)\n20 Somebody Bigger Than You And I (takes 8 &amp; 15)\n\n\nRipped by Ozark and uploaded to Hunger City February 2012\n\n\nNotes From Elvis On CD\n\nThe third of a series of four wonderful boxsets in an outstanding sound quality.
