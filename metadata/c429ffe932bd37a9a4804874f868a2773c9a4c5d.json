Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially &quot;Burnin' for You&quot;, received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÃƒâ€“C's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c429ffe932bd37a9a4804874f868a2773c9a4c5d","amp;dn":"B.O.C.+-+Radios+Appear%3A+Best+Of+The+Broadcasts+%5B2012%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c429ffe932bd37a9a4804874f868a2773c9a4c5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,41,255,233,50,189,55,169,164,128,72,116,248,104,162,119,60,154,76,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
