Built 500 years before the iconic monument of Stonehenge, the temple is opening new windows onto the beliefs of Neolithic people, turning the map of ancient Britain upside down. This is a vast site of undisturbed archaeology, set within one of the most important ancient landscapes in the world. Already the site is revealing a series of incredible finds including the first ever discovery of Neolithic painted wall decorations, and even the pigments and paint pots used by Stone Age artists. All the new archaeological evidence, and the wonders of special effects, has now been used to create a 3-D world of the entire temple, allowing Neil to walk inside in a bid to understand just how it might have been used.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deaa1123d923472eafe4169316ed0b1869f56566","amp;dn":"A+History+of+Ancient+Britain+Special%3A+Orkney%5C%27s+Stone+Age+Temple","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deaa1123d923472eafe4169316ed0b1869f56566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,170,17,35,217,35,71,46,175,228,22,147,22,237,11,24,105,245,101,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
