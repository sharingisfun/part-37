Tony Clarkin was much happier acting as producer, following his working relationship with Keith Olsen on Goodnight L.A.. Learning from Keith Olsen, Tony had enough experience to produce Magnum&amp;#039;s records on his own, also being the best option to cut production costs for future albums.\n\n&quot;Only In America&quot; was lifted as a single, but following poor sales figures, the second single, &quot;You&amp;#039;re The One&quot; was cancelled.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nTony Clarkin ?
