Mary is an adult female facing the daunting task of raising her offspring in a landscape where nearly half of all cubs die before they reach adulthood. Her biggest challenge is finding food for her two cubs, hunting and scavenging across a wide area while staying clear of the many threats from other animals. She needs to gain enough weight for her body fat to keep herself and her cubs alive during their next six-month period of hibernation. Thumper, a three-year- old male, left his mother's side only a year ago and is still learning about the rules of survival in a valley teeming with predators and prey. Thumper's curiosity frequently leads him into danger. Having previously strayed too close to a human encampment, he has been electronically tagged by park wardens to ensure that he keeps his distance. If Thumper steps across the line again he will have to be shot. Happily, he is showing signs of having learned from previous experiences.\nYellowstone is a place where people are happy to co- exist with other species, but having been hunted to the brink of extinction over the centuries, the grizzly remains proudly defiant.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/1176/ffa8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/1176/ffa8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/127/zi2g.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/127/zi2g.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/6471/hkwa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/6471/hkwa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/4289/z772.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/4289/z772.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/8603/1ret.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/8603/1ret.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/803/5qxx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/803/5qxx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5471/2u5q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5471/2u5q.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/1743/v39u.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/1743/v39u.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3996/0l8r.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3996/0l8r.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;571a363e39171b647966&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1846 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 50mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: average 666 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f56038079d022ec00666253ccaab199c7a07d521","amp;dn":"PBS+Grizzly+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f56038079d022ec00666253ccaab199c7a07d521","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,96,56,7,157,2,46,192,6,102,37,60,202,171,25,156,122,7,213,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
