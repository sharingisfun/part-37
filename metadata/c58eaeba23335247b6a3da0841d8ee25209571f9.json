RENTOKILL is one of the very few recognized upcoming Austrian acts that were able to score a record contract. Their back-catalogue includes two self-released EPs, their critically acclaimed debut full-length album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back To ConvenienceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and their groundbreaking effort &quot;AntiChorus&quot;. They have also appeared countless punk compilations, the most outstanding ones are the LEATHERFACE Tribute Compilation on Rubberfactory Records and also some Charity / Benefit Compilations in support of Animal &amp; Human Rights.\n\nBlasting intense Punk Rock with a political and powerful message, AustriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very own RENTOKILL have been almost constantly on tour since their inception. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always this tasty note of individuality and progression in their music, outlined by fast and exact drumming, striking melodies and hard driven guitars which are flowing aggressively along under the well thought out socio-political lyrics and the vocalistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characteristic rasping voice. Nothing but raw emotion framed by catchy punkrock, and their fifteen-song studio album ANTICHORUS captures it perfectly.\n\n&quot;ANTICHORUS&quot; is RENTOKILLÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2nd full length record and had been recorded in early 2006 at the Sideburn Studios in Vienna and mastered at the WEST WEST SIDE MUSIC Studios in the USA by Alan Douches, who already had worked with bands such as STRIKE ANYWHERE, TRIAL BY FIRE, GIVE UP THE GHOST and NONE MORE BLACK.\n\nSpeaking of &quot;Antichorus&quot;, the album has been released through RUDE RECORDS and NOREASON RECORDS from Italy on CD-Digipack. The wonderfully looking gatefold double-colored vinyl edition is available through Broken Heart Records from Austria. \n\n\n1   Discontent Industry\n2   The Political Aspect Of Unpolitical Thinking\n3   War In The Shadows\n4   Primetime Killers\n5   Step Over The Wall\n6   Abandoning Democracy\n7   Collection Complete!\n8   Z-7110\n9   Portrait Of Conformity\n10  Kingdom\n11  Anti #2\n12  System Failure\n13  This Time We Try To Separate\n14  Abandoning The Natural Habitats\n15  Para Fin[e]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58eaeba23335247b6a3da0841d8ee25209571f9","amp;dn":"Rentokill+-+AntiChorus+%5B2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58eaeba23335247b6a3da0841d8ee25209571f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,142,174,186,35,51,82,71,182,163,218,8,65,216,238,37,32,149,113,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
