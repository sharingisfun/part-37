Into these camps were sent Jews, prisoners-of-war, resistance fighters, Gypsies, and other people considered enemies of the Third Reich.\n\nThe largest of these camps was the one called Auschwitz, located in Poland. Those interned at Auschwitz came from all over Europe and consisted of men, women, and children. Those able to work were used as labor for the German war effort. Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet Army in January of 1945.\n\nBut that is where the consensus ends.\n\nWarning: hardsubbed in Portuguese.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebae81b18f7ef0bdcf6931b10b4a05730787926e","amp;dn":"David+Cole+Interviews+dr.+Franciszek+Piper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebae81b18f7ef0bdcf6931b10b4a05730787926e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,174,129,177,143,126,240,189,207,105,49,177,11,74,5,115,7,135,146,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
