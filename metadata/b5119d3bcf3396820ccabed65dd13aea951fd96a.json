K. Haghi et al. (AAP, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4665-6876-1\r\n\r\nThis new book provides a solid understanding of the recent developments in the field of composites and nanocomposites. It explains the significance of the new fillers, such as graphene and arbon nanotubes in different matrix systems. The application of these materials in biological and others fields also makes this book unique. This detailed study of nanocomposites, their structure, processing and characterization will be of value in all walks of engineering life.\r\n\r\nThe book covers the following topics:\r\nâ€¢ polymer matrix composites\r\nâ€¢ ceramic matrix composites\r\nâ€¢ carbon matrix composites\r\nâ€¢ wood-based composites\r\nâ€¢ biocomposites\r\nâ€¢ ecocomposites\r\nâ€¢ nanocomposites\r\nâ€¢ processing\r\nâ€¢ properties\r\nâ€¢ fracture and damage mechanics\r\nâ€¢ durability\r\nâ€¢ and more\r\n\r\nComposite materials are solids that contain two or more distinct constituent materials or phases, on a scale larger than the atomic. The term â€œcompositeâ€ is usually reserved for those materials in which the distinct phases are separated on a scale larger than the atomic, and in which properties such as the elastic modulus are significantly altered in comparison with those of a homogeneous material. Composites have properties that cannot be achieved by either of the constituent materials alone. Composites are becoming more and more important as they can help improve our quality of life. Composites are put into service in flight vehicles, automobiles, boats, pipelines, buildings, roads, bridges, and dozens of other products. Researchers are finding ways to improve other qualities of composites so they may be strong, lightweight, long-lived, and inexpensive to produce. The science and engineering of composites and nanocomposites draws on traditional characterization and processing technologies. Research describing structures containing nanoparticles seems to rely on methods that are being pushed to the limit of resolution. Preparation of nanocomposites also poses very real processing challenges. The list of questions about the fabrication, characterization, and use of nanocomposites is long despite massive financial and intellectual investment. The magnitude of the effects these small particles impart to the bulk properties of a composite are great enough that the science is likely to continue to grow in importance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5119d3bcf3396820ccabed65dd13aea951fd96a","amp;dn":"Composites+and+Nanocomposites+-+A.+K.+Haghi+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5119d3bcf3396820ccabed65dd13aea951fd96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,17,157,59,207,51,150,130,12,202,190,214,93,209,58,234,149,31,217,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
