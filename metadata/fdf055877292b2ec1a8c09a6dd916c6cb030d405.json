Drummer Michael Cartellone has recorded and toured with the band since 1999. \n\nLynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006.\n\nFollowing a performance at Greenville, South Carolina, on October 20, 1977 the band boarded a  CV-300 to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to appear at LSU. \nDue to a faulty engine, the airplane crashed five miles northeast of Gillsburg, Mississippi. \nRonnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary, and co-pilot William Gray were killed on impact; the other band members (Collins, Rossington, Wilkeson, Powell, Pyle, and Hawkins), tour manager Ron Eckerman, and road crew suffered serious injuries.\n\nThe accident came just three days after the release of Street Survivors. Following the crash and the ensuing press, Street Survivors became the band's second platinum album.\nLynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting just once to perform an instrumental version of &quot;Free Bird&quot; at Charlie Daniels' Volunteer Jam V in January 1979.\n Collins, Rossington, Powell and Pyle performed the song with Charlie Daniels and  his band. \nLeon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins.\n\nIn 1980, Allen Collins' wife Kathy died of a massive hemorrhage while miscarrying their third child. \nHe formed the Allen Collins Band in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington-Collins Band and released one album, but many around him believed that the guitarist's heart just was not in it anymore. \nMost point to his wife's death as the moment that Collins' life began to spin out of control; he spent several years binging on drugs and alcohol. \nIn 1986, Collins crashed his car while driving drunk in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend and leaving himself permanently paralyzed from the chest down. Collins  pled no contest to DUI manslaughter, but was not given a prison sentence since he would never drive or be a danger to society again.\n\nIn 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the pre-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. \nRonnie Van Zant's younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. \nDue to Collins' paralysis, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. \n\nAs part of his plea deal, Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before &quot;That Smell&quot;, which had been directed at him). \nCollins was stricken with pneumonia in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990.\n\nOn January 28, 2009, keyboardist Billy Powell died of a suspected heart attack at age 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida. \nNo autopsy was ever carried out. Powell's death left Gary Rossington as the sole pre-crash member still in the band, unless Rickey Medlocke is counted.\n\nOn May 2, 2012, the band announced the impending release of a new studio album, Last of a Dyin' Breed, along with a North American and European tour. \nOn August 21, 2012, Last of a Dyin' Breed was released. \n\n\nWhile promoting the album September 9, 2012, members of the band talked about its discontinued use of Confederate imagery. \nIn September 2012, the band briefly did not display the Confederate Flag, which had for years been a part of their stage show, because of racists who had adopted the flag. \nAfter protests they reversed this decision, noting it is part of their Southern American heritage and states rights symbolism.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the group No. 95 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nOn November 28, 2005, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced that Lynyrd Skynyrd would be inducted alongside Black Sabbath, and the Sex Pistols.\n \nThey were inducted on March 13, 2006 during the Hall's 21st annual induction ceremony. \nThe inductees included Ronnie Van Zant, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, Ed King, Steve Gaines, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson, Bob Burns, and Artimus Pyle.  \n\n \nThe current version of Skynyrd, augmented by King, Pyle, Burns and former Honkettes JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins, performed &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; and &quot;Free Bird&quot; at the ceremony, which was also attended by Judy Van Zant Jenness and Ronnie's two daughters, Teresa Gaines and her daughter Corinna, Allen Collins' daughters, and Leon Wilkeson's mother and son.\n\nIn October 2008, Lynyrd Skynyrd's song &quot;Free Bird&quot;'s solo was named the 3rd greatest guitar solo by Guitar World. In September 2010, Lynyrd Skynyrd was named No. 77 VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1. &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (Ed King, Gary Rossington, Ronnie Van Zant) - 7:29 \n    \n2. &quot;Free Bird&quot; (Allen Collins, Ronnie Van Zant) - 14:25 \n\n\n\nBoth tracks taken from One More From the Road \n\nPersonnel Line up from The Fabulous Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia 1976.\n\n    Ronnie Van Zant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals\n    Steve Gaines - guitar, backing vocals\n    Allen Collins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Gary Rossington Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, keyboards\n    Billy Powell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n    Leon Wilkeson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals\n    Artimus Pyle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    JoJo Billingsley, Cassie Gaines, Leslie Hawkins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals\n\n\nThese two songs are probably the most requested songs from their catalog\n \nAnd yes: He will Ask you &quot;What song is it you want to Hear?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdf055877292b2ec1a8c09a6dd916c6cb030d405","amp;dn":"Lynyrd+Skynyrd+-+Sweet+Home+Alabama+and+Freebird+%28Singles%29320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdf055877292b2ec1a8c09a6dd916c6cb030d405","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,240,85,135,114,146,178,236,26,140,9,166,221,145,108,108,176,48,212,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
