Lifted from the tracklist of his acclaimed 2012 &quot;Pure&quot; album, it once again teams producer Richard Mowatt with the singular vocal talents of Clare Stagg. \n\nWith the listeners of Armin van Buuren's ASOT radio show voting their first outing together (&quot;The Spell&quot;) as one of the 15 most popular trancers of 2012, the scene has been well and truly set for its follow-up.\n\nKicking off with his flagship Pure Mix, Solarstone elevates the tempo and tone and aims straight for big room boom. Fast running bass and fluid modulating sub-melodies all raise the mix's mercury. Massing its pads, chords and synths, it seizes the floor with maximum traction, allowing Clare Stagg's ethereal voice and stargazing lyrics to steal the breath at the peak of the break.\n\nIn every sense a &quot;Jewel&quot; in the &quot;Pure&quot; album's crown, the single's out on the 28th of January.\n\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e594c1627a49c3a635001c39f4e0398764d4e9","amp;dn":"SOLARSTONE+and+CLARE+STAGG+-+Jewel+%282013%29+Trance+Singles+WEB+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e594c1627a49c3a635001c39f4e0398764d4e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,229,148,193,98,122,73,195,166,53,0,28,57,244,224,57,135,100,212,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
