It is a psychological thriller starring Margot Kidder as a French-Canadian model who is shadowed by her psychotic former Siamese twin.\n\nDe Palma was inspired by reading an article about the Soviet Siamese twins Masha and Dasha.[1] The film is heavily influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, and de Palma even persuaded Hitchcock&amp;#039;s semi-retired composer, Bernard Herrmann, to write the score.[2] The film also uses unusual point of view shots and split screen effects to show two events happening similtaneously.\n\nIMDB: 6.9/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0070698/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0070698/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3399ec5d0c6a8f50ea2a4ab65dfa3aaa35588d8a","amp;dn":"Brian+De+Palma+-+Irm%C3%A3s+Diab%C3%B3licas+%28Sisters%29+-+1973+-+USA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3399ec5d0c6a8f50ea2a4ab65dfa3aaa35588d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,153,236,93,12,106,143,80,234,42,74,182,93,250,58,170,53,88,141,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
