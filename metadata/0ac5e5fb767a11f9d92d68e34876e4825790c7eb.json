There are some things in the musical world that just belong together (well, maybe not Loggins and MessinaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦), and that includes the super duo Simon and Garfunkel. In the 1960s and '70s you could get no bigger than the dwarfish Paul Simon and the billow-headed Art Garfunkel. The two mystical-voiced musicians composed some of the best loved tunes of their generation, including The Boxer, Bridge Over Troubled Water, and the hit  Mrs. Robinson, from the film The Graduate. In 1982, the pair got together more than a decade after their spilt for a legendary concert in Central Park, New York, to play some of their biggest hits to a very appreciative crowd. Now fans the world over can experience this concert on DVD with Simon and Garfunkel: The Concert in Central Park.\n\nhttp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0218896/\nHoppas det faller er i smaken.
