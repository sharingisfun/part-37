Kenickie are self-styled adolescents, making a big deal of their age, not only in their surprisingly funny lyrics, but in the way their guitars and drums bounce off each other, creating a wonderful cacophony. And just as wonderful are the songs themselves, filled with hooks and melodies that ring in the head, especially since they're delivered with ragged, invigorating enthusiasm. &quot;Punka,&quot; &quot;Come out 2 Nite,&quot; &quot;P.V.C.,&quot; and &quot;In Your Car&quot; all date from early singles, yet they've lost none of their power. More importantly, Kenickie have come up with another batch of originals that are just as strong, making At the Club a terrific punk-pop debut.
