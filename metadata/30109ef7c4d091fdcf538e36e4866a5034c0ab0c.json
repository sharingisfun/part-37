Accordind to Cruz his inspiration came from &quot;wanting to do things on a bike&quot; since his previous videos included cars and boats. &quot;So you're gonna see me spin the tires on this, which is pretty cool!&quot;. One of the vehicles brought for the video shoot was a &quot;massive truck&quot; which was used to film big screen project &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;.
