It was first published by Eternity Comics and then Amazing Comics. Contractual problems resulted in a move to Pied Piper Comics. A legal dispute followed, and after running out of money for the struggle, the creators surrendered. The title returned to Eternity Comics and was later published in a revamped version by Malibu Comics, which Eternity had become an imprint of. A video game for the Sega Genesis based on the Malibu version was released.\n\nThe series is set in a not too distant future, where an all-out war has decimated the planet, and the hapless survivors and their offspring have been horribly mutated by the toxins released into the environment.\n\nA lone scientist, the three-eyed Dr. Emmanuel Cugat, selects five mutants, one male and four females, to be genetically altered, re-sequencing their mutated DNA to restore them to humanity. Belushi, Erin, Angela, Vikki and Lorelei become perfect physical specimens. Dr. Cugat then sends them forth to inspire the shattered Earth. Many of the mutants have other ideas, particularly their arch nemesis, the monstrous Great Fred.\n\nThe series was perhaps best described by author Lawrence in a 2004 interview in the webzine QRD as &quot;a light-hearted post-nuclear adventure series. The message if there was one, and I didn't really think about it at the time, seems to be no matter how badly we fuck up we'll get by.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b1d38eb8ff5313cfff82ec970125cc8b72d8ab8","amp;dn":"Ex-Mutants+1-18+%2B+Microseries+Erin+%281992%29+%5BMalibu%5D+%28Requested%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b1d38eb8ff5313cfff82ec970125cc8b72d8ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,29,56,235,143,245,49,60,255,248,46,201,112,18,92,200,183,45,138,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
