Rupe appears to have vanished without trace. Reluctantly, Lance goes to London, to discover that Rupe's employers want him tried for fraud. A Japanese businessman claims he has stolen a document of huge importance. And a private detective is demanding money for trying to trace, on Rupe's behalf, an American called Townley, who was involved in a mysterious death at Wilderness Farm, near Glastonbury, back in 1963. No sooner has Lance decided that whatever Rupe was up to is too risky to get involved in than he finds that he already is involved, and the only way out is to get in deeper still. Where is Rupe? What is the document he has stolen? Who is Townley? And what happened at Wilderness Farm nearly thirty years before that holds the key to a secret more amazing than Lance Bradley could ever have imagined?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:973deee11b4d29dcfdd9ffa7c8b3869924264456","amp;dn":"Dying+to+Tell+-+Robert+Goddard++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"973deee11b4d29dcfdd9ffa7c8b3869924264456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,61,238,225,27,77,41,220,253,217,255,167,200,179,134,153,36,38,68,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
