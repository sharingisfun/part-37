I'm just doing it (and most of my torrenting) for the absolute heck of it.\n\nThis particular collection has the official music for Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3, as well as an unofficial soundtrack for Halo 3. (I have no idea how it came to be, but I have it.)\n\nAnd before you complain: No, I don't have the final track in the official Halo 3 because I originally thought it was junk and deleted it. Then I found a track listing while making a playlist with the single album WMP sees. I haven't worried about finding it special, so if something else has it and you want a complete album, go for that one. Like I said, I do this for the absolute heck of it. :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371f79dd7c21045e3da08757d4cea2181e66f49c","amp;dn":"Halo+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371f79dd7c21045e3da08757d4cea2181e66f49c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,31,121,221,124,33,4,94,61,160,135,87,212,206,162,24,30,102,244,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
