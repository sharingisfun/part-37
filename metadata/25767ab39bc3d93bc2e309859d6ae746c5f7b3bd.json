Their debut EP, V for Villendetta was launched in February in Melbourne and Adelaide, and held the number #1 spot on Adelaide station ThreeD Radio for 4 consecutive weeks.\r\nï»¿\r\nThe Villenettes love Elvis, Sailor Jerry, vintage guitars, bad horror movies, leather jackets, leopard print dresses, and running amok on a Saturday night. They play original rockâ€™nâ€™roll with a splash of surf, a shimmy of girl group and a razor edge of zombie punk. The Villenettes want to make you dance like the devil and party like itâ€™s 1959.\r\nâ€‹\r\nKnown for their loyal following, unique aesthetic and live shows that can include anything from life-sized Elvis cutouts to audience drinking games, The Villenettes are Anna Bouras (recently nominated for AU Review's 2014 SA Vocalist of The Year), Kylie Porter (bass &amp; vocals), Jessica Zubkevych (guitar) and Clair Oâ€™Boyle (drums).ï»¿ï»¿\r\n\r\nThis is their 2015 album, Lady Luck","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25767ab39bc3d93bc2e309859d6ae746c5f7b3bd","amp;dn":"The+Villenettes+-+2015+-+Lady+Luck","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25767ab39bc3d93bc2e309859d6ae746c5f7b3bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,118,122,179,155,195,217,59,194,227,9,133,157,106,231,70,197,247,179,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
