The occasional early song such as &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Take It Easy&quot; turn up, as do selections from Joe Walsh's solo career, &quot;Life's Been Good&quot; and &quot;All Night Long.&quot; Walsh introduces some live variations to his material; the rest of the Eagles seem determined to re-create the studio versions of their songs in concert. The previously unrecorded rendition of Steve Young's &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot; is welcome, and the album would have benefited from more such surprises.\n\nEagles Live is the first live album by the American rock band Eagles, a two-LP set released in 1980. The Eagles unofficially disbanded on July 31, 1980 after their concert at Long Beach. However, the band still owed Elektra/Asylum a live record from the tour. Eagles Live (released that November) was mixed by Glenn Frey and Don Henley on opposite coasts - the two decided they could not stand to be in the same state, let alone the same studio, and as Bill Szymczyk put it, the record's perfect three-part harmonies were fixed &quot;courtesy of Federal Express.&quot; The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide said it is &quot;perhaps the most heavily overdubbed [live album] in history.&quot; &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot; was released as a single and would become a top-40 hit. The song was a showcase for the band's close harmony singing; the first and last verses feature all five Eagles singing in five-part harmony.\n\n01 - Hotel California\n02 - Heartache Tonight\n03 - I Can't Tell You Why\n04 - The Long Run\n05 - New Kid In Town\n06 - Life's Been Good\n07 - Seven Bridges Road\n08 - Wasted Time\n09 - Take It To The Limit\n10 - Doolin-Dalton (Reprise II)\n11 - Desperado\n12 - Saturday Night\n13 - All Night Long\n14 - Life In The Fast Lane\n15 - Take It Easy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9ef756a421898985e2629449ce03be363658778","amp;dn":"Eagles+-+Live+%281980%29+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9ef756a421898985e2629449ce03be363658778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,239,117,106,66,24,152,152,94,38,41,68,156,224,59,227,99,101,135,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
