It's a space opera in the most unique scale with a style that only VVVVVV can bring to you. Instead of jumping, control the direction of gravity by inverting your gravity and allowing Captain Viridian to flip between the floors and ceilings of the environment.\n\nFor adventurers who save the dimension, there's still hours and hours of new gameplay with all-new Player Levels. Test your mettle and see if you have what it takes to beat a collection of levels created by other famous game developers.\n\nInspired by classic 8-bit days gone-by and now with experience-heightening 3D, VVVVVV will challenge even the most battle-hardened old-school gamers.\n\nFeatures\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Old-School 8-bit style graphics\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ All-new Player Levels\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Control gravity to complete challenges\nTo enjoy the 3D effect of Nintendo 3DS software, you must experience it from the system itself.
