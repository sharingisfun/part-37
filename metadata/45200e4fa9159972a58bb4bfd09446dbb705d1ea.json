In this Oscar winning short film, celebrated director Chris Landreth uses a hand-animated, three dimensional technique he calls &quot;psychological realism&quot; to tell Ryan&amp;#039;s story. Today, Ryan Larkin lives on welfare and panhandles for spare change in downtown Montreal, Canada. This film explores Ryan&amp;#039;s early works and asks how an artistic genius could follow such an unfortunate path.\n\n A gentleman panhandler. One of the pioneers of Canadian animation. Oscar nominee. Poor beggar. An artist unable to create. God observing the world. Fallen angel. Arrogant. Shy. Broken. Not destroyed. Ryan hovers between animation and documentary, and defies easy definition. Ryan Larkin who produced some of the most influential animated films of his time today lives on welfare and panhandles in Montreal. How could such an artistic genius follow this path?\n\nStars: Ryan Larkin, Chris Landreth\nOther Stars: Derek Lamb, Felicity Fanjoy, Laurence Green\nDirector: Chris Landreth, Laurence Green, Ryan Larkin\nMusic by: Fergus Marsh, Michael White\nEdited by: Alan Code\nGenre: animation\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45200e4fa9159972a58bb4bfd09446dbb705d1ea","amp;dn":"Ryan+2004+DVDRip+XviD+FiNaLe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45200e4fa9159972a58bb4bfd09446dbb705d1ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,32,14,79,169,21,153,114,165,139,180,191,208,148,70,219,183,5,209,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
