Schmit is one of the most talented of the members of the Eagles, and it shows on this album. Some of the songs that I think are really good are Something Sad, In Roxy&amp;#039;x Eyes, and For the Children. It would be hard to say which is my favorite song, but it is definately one of my favorite CDS. If you like the ballads of the Eagles you will really like this album. \n\nInformation Disc:\n?
