The player must guide Lara through\nphysics puzzles, challenging environments, and a high-octane story to\novercome a harrowing situation and make it off of the island alive\n\nCombat - Tomb Raider is pushing the action genre forward with visceral\nthird-person combat and a deep weapon and gear upgrade system that Lara\nwill have to strategically employ to overcome increasingly difficult\nenemies and environments, all with a unique Survival Action twist\n\nDynamic Traversal it wouldn t be Tomb Raider without certain\nsignature elements.
