In this first part the resurgence of Romanism is examined and the stuttering and sputtering of present day Protestantism is also set forth. Evangelists used to be wide-eyed to the might of Communism, but tightlipped at the menace of Romanism. Times have changed since then and they for the most part today are not even concerned about the might of Communism. However, it is still true that most evangelists and most ministers and most Americans are completely silent when it comes to a Biblical evaluation of Romanism or any false religion today. Find out how romanism and its offshots have completely perverted Biblical Christianity and are today using it for their own purposes. 45 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ac56326327722ac95d32915f64638caa4031f2a","amp;dn":"Cooke-Decline+of+Historic+Bible+Protestantism+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ac56326327722ac95d32915f64638caa4031f2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,197,99,38,50,119,34,172,149,211,41,21,246,70,56,202,164,3,31,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
