Biomedical imaging offers useful information on patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ medical conditions and clues to causes of their symptoms and diseases. Biomedical images, however, provide a large number of images which physicians must interpret. Therefore, computer aids are demanded and become indispensable in physiciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ decision making. This book discusses major technical advancements and research findings in the field of computational intelligence in biomedical imaging, for example, computational intelligence in computer-aided diagnosis for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and brain disease, in lung function analysis, and in radiation therapy. The book examines technologies and studies that have reached the practical level, and those technologies that are becoming available in clinical practices in hospitals rapidly such as computational intelligence in computer-aided diagnosis, biological image analysis, and computer-aided surgery and therapy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea684c79c5b0c652a3bf6e475469e7351818adb","amp;dn":"Computational+Intelligence+in+Biomedical+Imaging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea684c79c5b0c652a3bf6e475469e7351818adb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,166,132,199,156,91,12,101,42,59,246,228,117,70,158,115,81,129,138,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
