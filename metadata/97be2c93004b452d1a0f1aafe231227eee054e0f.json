By building up from the basics, and demonstrating the relationships between the various branches of combinatorics, Victor Bryant provides a readable text that presents its results in a straightforward way. Numerous examples and exercises, including hints and solutions, are included throughout and serve to lead the reader to some of the deeper results of the subject, many of which are usually excluded from elementary texts. This is an excellent textbook, by an experienced author, for introductory courses in combinatorics and graph theory\n\nAspects of Combinatorics,\nVictor Bryant,\n274 pages, Cambridge University Press, 1993.\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97be2c93004b452d1a0f1aafe231227eee054e0f","amp;dn":"Aspects+of+Combinatorics+-+Victor+Bryant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97be2c93004b452d1a0f1aafe231227eee054e0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,190,44,147,0,75,69,45,26,15,26,175,226,49,34,126,238,5,78,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
