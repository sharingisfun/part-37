But the days of sketches and slides have given way to arrangements of digital assets that are both simpler and more complex than their traditional analog counterparts.\n\nInstructor and design professional Cynthia Baron covers all the facets that artists need to know, from choosing the best work for a particular audience to using various file formats to organizing, designing, and presenting the portfolio. Beautiful full-color illustrations demonstrate her instructions, and case studies throughout portray examples of attractive and effective portfolio design. This book gives artists at any level a creative edge, ensuring that their portfolios get noticed and help them stand out from the crowd.\n\n\n# Paperback: 360 pages\n# Publisher: New Riders Press; 2 edition (August 27, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321637518\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321637512","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:070429b6df4f28c990651f4b44bbf1658c2ad4a2","amp;dn":"Designing+a+Digital+Portfolio%2C2nd+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"070429b6df4f28c990651f4b44bbf1658c2ad4a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,4,41,182,223,79,40,201,144,101,31,75,68,187,241,101,140,42,212,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
