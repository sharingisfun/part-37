Unfortunately, its creator was afraid of getting sued so he stopped making it (conveniently in the .99 version) and stopped all downloads. For this reason the .99 is very rare and I thought I'd upload it to a greater audience. Note: I believe this only works on 64-bit Windows systems. Feel free to prove me wrong.\n\nTo Play:\n\n1. Copy ufo_099 folder wherever you want. The application is inside and you may or may not want to create a shortcut of that.\n2. Start up the config application to change res and other stuff.\n3. start up &quot;Ufo&quot; or Ufo_sh1&quot; (I haven't found out what the diffrence is between the files is)\n\nHave fun!\n\n\nDreadhawk177","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1abbfe85ffaf1398a9ccc8daf79e0b1db87c5f58","amp;dn":"X-COM%3A+The+Two+Sides","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1abbfe85ffaf1398a9ccc8daf79e0b1db87c5f58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,187,254,133,255,175,19,152,169,204,200,218,247,158,11,29,184,124,95,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
