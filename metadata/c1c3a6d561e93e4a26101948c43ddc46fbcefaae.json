They created an earthy music made up of playful, catchy melodies with male/female vocal interplay. Their material is pure, often foot-stomping folk with Norwegian vocals. Despite the mostly minor keys, it is fresh and exhilirating and dons some wonderful arrangements.\n\nHighly recommended to fans of Malicorne, The Pogues, Kebnekaise and Gryphon as well as those into Nordic and Irish folk. \n\n192kbs\n\n1.
