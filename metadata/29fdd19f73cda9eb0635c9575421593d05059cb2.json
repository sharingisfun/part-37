Four years later in the midst of his Great Sadness, Mack receives a suspicious note, apparently from God, inviting him back to that shack for a weekend. Against his better judgment he arrives at the shack on a wintry afternoon and walks back into his darkest nightmare. What he finds there will change Mack's world forever. In a world where religion seems to grow increasingly irrelevant &quot;The Shack&quot; wrestles with the timeless question, &quot;Where is God in a world so filled with unspeakable pain?&quot; The answers Mack gets will astound you and perhaps transform you as much as it did him. You'll want everyone you know to read this book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29fdd19f73cda9eb0635c9575421593d05059cb2","amp;dn":"The+Shack+audiobook+by+William+P.+Young+EarReaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29fdd19f73cda9eb0635c9575421593d05059cb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,253,209,159,115,205,169,235,6,53,201,87,84,33,89,61,5,5,156,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
