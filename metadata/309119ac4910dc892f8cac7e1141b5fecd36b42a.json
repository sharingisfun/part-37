He leads a team of &quot;Alphas&quot;, human beings with enhanced abilities due to differences in their brain structure: Gary Bell, a highly functioning autistic with an ability to process information that rivals most computers; Bill Harken, a former FBI agent who can amp up his &quot;fight or flight&quot; reflex, giving him extraordinary strength for a brief period of time; Nina Theroux, a beautiful woman who can reprogram other people's minds to do as she bids; and Rachel Pirzad, a sheltered Persian girl who can intensify one sense at the expense of the others. However, with said powers comes a price - for Gary, autism which makes him a child for all intents and purposes; for Harken, severe anger issues that cost him his job and family; for Rachel, struggling to overcome her parents shame at her &quot;illness&quot;; and Nina, never really knowing how those close to her actually feel. \n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : Alphas.S02E09.HDTV.DivX-Atilla82.avi\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 350 MiB\nDuration : 42mn 11s\nOverall bit rate : 1 158 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 5\nDuration : 42mn 11s\nBit rate : 1 021 Kbps\nWidth : 680 pixels\nHeight : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.163\nStream size : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : DivX 3330\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 42mn 11s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 38.6 MiB (11%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n\n\nscreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pohrani.com/f/q/LV/11h7G9Wq/screenshots.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pohrani.com/f/q/LV/11h7G9Wq/screenshots.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:309119ac4910dc892f8cac7e1141b5fecd36b42a","amp;dn":"Alphas.S02E09.HDTV.DivX-Atilla82","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"309119ac4910dc892f8cac7e1141b5fecd36b42a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,145,25,172,73,16,220,137,47,140,172,126,17,65,181,254,205,54,180,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
