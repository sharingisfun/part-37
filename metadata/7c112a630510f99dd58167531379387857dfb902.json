They were more a pop and vocal group than a psychedelic band although they experienced at times with psych-pop (&quot;Miss Judith Lee&quot; for instance). This compilation of singles and album tracks (they released two lp's) was released by Universal (Universal 018 333-2 /2003).\nThey never entered the top ten chart in Sweden but became popular in Denmark, Belgium and Holland. They toured a lot and when in England they met Eric Stewart (later in 10cc) who helped them with several songs.\n\nRewiev of the album (in swediash) here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musiklandet.se/ml/index.nsf/1?Open&amp;a=re&amp;id=57F63467CEEE2967C1256D0F00470841&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musiklandet.se/ml/index.nsf/1?Open&amp;a=re&amp;id=57F63467CEEE2967C1256D0F00470841&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nJackpots - Jack In The Box\nThis compilation 2003\n\n01  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Walk Like A Man\n02  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Younger Girl\n03  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Back To The City\n04  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Funny How Love Can Be\n05  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Tossing And Turning\n06  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Jack In The Box\n07  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Tiny Goddess\n08  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - When I Whisper Your Name\n09  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - I Hear Trumpets Blow\n10  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Lincoln City\n11  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - The Power Of Love\n12  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - See You In September\n13  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - You'll Never Get The Chance Again\n14  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Miss Judith Lee\n15  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n16  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Little Girl I Once Knew\n17  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - King Of The World\n18  Jackpots - Jack In The Box - Shadows And Refections\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c112a630510f99dd58167531379387857dfb902","amp;dn":"Jackpots+-+Jack+In+The+Box+%282003%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c112a630510f99dd58167531379387857dfb902","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,17,42,99,5,16,249,157,213,129,103,83,19,121,56,120,87,223,185,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
