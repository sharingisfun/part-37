Among the objects included are rhyta, bowls, cups, jewelry, and decorative gold and silver ornaments for horse bridles and clothing.

Of particular importance is the inclusion of illustrations of some fifty little-known comparative objects as well as extensive bibliographic references.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54b71a589b0028a37ecbec8af56540e35182ad5d","amp;dn":"Metalwork+from+the+Hellenized+East+-+Catalogue+of+the+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54b71a589b0028a37ecbec8af56540e35182ad5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,183,26,88,155,0,40,163,126,203,236,138,245,101,64,227,81,130,173,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
