Experience an ironic story-driven RPG with\nhumorous dialogue-puzzles in the style of Monkey Island as well as\na strategic combat system, where your party members are controlled\nsimultaneously. Our story starts as the citizens of the Kingdom of Glory\ncelebrate their victory over the Dark Church. While in the catacombs of\ntheir former enemies, their revelry is disturbed by a sudden\nall-encompassing fog. The citizens wrapped by the fog disappear screaming\ninto nothing. Those that remain alive after the strange attack, barricade\nthemselves in the depths of the catacombs. As time passes, food becomes\nscarce and the people of the Kingdom of Glory begin to realize that they\nmight all meet their demise. The heroic Knights of Glory, shady\nmercenaries and the arrogant high elves band together into guilds in order\nto survive and escape the dank catacombs. Unfortunately, the guilds are far\ntoo concerned with their distaste for each other and are oblivious to the\nawakening of dark forces in the dungeons below\n\nInstallation Information\n=========================\n\nBurn or mount\nInstall\nPlay the game\n\n/TEAM FAiRLIGHT\n\n-  QUALITY, TRADITION  AND PRIDE -\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOperating system:WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP / VistaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ / WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7\nProcessor: Dual-Core 2.2 GHz CPU\nMemory: 2GB\nHard disk space: 1GB\nVideo:Direct X 9.0c compatible with shader model 2.0 (nVidia GeForce 5/FX/ATI Radeon 9500 Series/ATI X700 or better)\nSound:Sound card with DirectX 9.0c support\nDirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®: DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c\n\n\nPoster:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bN0qq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bN0qq.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nScreens:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bN0qq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bN0qq.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VzZHm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VzZHm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DHJzY.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DHJzY.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd75a5b2bb098a8727c858df57c6e7dbf25497e2","amp;dn":"Grotesque+Tactics+2+Dungeons+and+Donuts-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd75a5b2bb098a8727c858df57c6e7dbf25497e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,117,165,178,187,9,138,135,39,200,88,223,87,198,231,219,242,84,151,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
