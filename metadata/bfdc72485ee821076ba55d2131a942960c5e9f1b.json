Naturally, the music heard in all the clubs and eateries is ahead of its time and more progressive...and always of superior quality. A seamless collection of tasty jazz treats. The disc is great to listen to intently or even as background at a special event.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfdc72485ee821076ba55d2131a942960c5e9f1b","amp;dn":"Saint-Germain+des+pr%C3%A9s+caf%C3%A9+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfdc72485ee821076ba55d2131a942960c5e9f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,220,114,72,94,232,33,7,107,165,93,33,49,169,66,150,12,94,159,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
