(1984)\n\nOn this reissue CD of a Contemporary set (bassist Leroy Vinnegar's first as a leader), six of the seven songs have the word &quot;walk&quot; in their title, including &quot;Would You Like to Take a Walk,&quot; &quot;Walkin' My Baby Back Home,&quot; &quot;I'll Walk Alone,&quot; and Vinnegar's original &quot;Walk On.&quot; Vinnegar actually does not take much solo space and generously features his talented sidemen: vibraphonist Victor Feldman, trumpeter Gerald Wilson, tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards, pianist Carl Perkins, and drummer Tony Bazley. A fine, straight-ahead session. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Walk On\n02 - Would You Like To Take A Walk\n03 - On The Sunny Side Of The Street\n04 - Walkin'\n05 - Walkin' My Baby Back Home\n06 - I'll Walk Alone\n07 - Walkin' By The River\n\nEnjoy and share!
