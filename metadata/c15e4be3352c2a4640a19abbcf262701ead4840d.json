Analog Soul. Now featuring all the creative focus effects of Bokeh, ExposureÃ¢â€žÂ¢ 6 brings even more of the organic warmth and artistry of analog photography to the world of digital. Borne from more than a decade of research and input from industry-leading photographers around the globe, Exposure 6 provides you with a platform to instill your images with the subtle nuances and analog beauty of film photography. With Exposure 6, your photo will look hand-crafted, not computer-generated.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSpeed!\nOur new preview system is much more interactive, which makes it easier to experiment and quickly explore presets. We also found ways to speed up our rendering, especially if you are using Photoshop CS5. Exposure 3 in 64-bit CS5 is over twice as fast as Exposure 2 in CS4 on the Mac and about 30% faster on Windows.\n\nPhotoshop CS5 64-bit Support\nExposure 3 works great with the 64-bit version of Photoshop CS5 on both Macintosh and Windows. This gives Exposure access to more memory and a speed boost.\n\nLightroom Support\nExposure 3 now works in Adobe Lightroom 2 or later. Our method of tight Lightroom integration provides batch processing and does not require Photoshop to be installed. See our Lightroom page for installation and usage advice.\n\nOver 500 Presets\nThere are now over 500 carefully designed factory presets in Exposure 3. Entire new categories have been added, such as Cinematography and Lo-Fi. New settings have been added in almost every other category too. Where appropriate, we enhanced existing settings with the new vignette, dust, and scratches features. We have two videos that give a tour through all of our factory presets. You can also visit our examples page to see many of ExposureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s effects.\n\nAging and Vintage Films\nMore vintage films have been added, including Technicolor movie film, early versions of Kodachrome, and Autochrome (one of the first color film processes). The illusion of age is enhanced by new features like dust, scratches, and vignettes. Visit our examples page to see these new effects.\n\nLo-Fi Photography\nToy cameras such as Lomo and Holga are extremely popular for creating odd special effects. Exposure 3 provides a wide range of looks from this Lo-Fi photography, including lens blur, warped vignettes, and funky colors from cross processing. Visit our examples page to see these new effects.\n\nEase of Use\nThe entire user interface has been rewritten from scratch. Here are some of the most noticeable results.\nThe preview image updates much faster.\nSettings can now have comments that appear as hover help. We added comments to some of the factory presets to help explain the best way to use them. You can add comments to your own saved settings too.\nThe mouse scroll wheel lets you quickly zoom to arbitrary levels.\nYou can duplicate a factory preset by dragging it into the User Settings list.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Already Great\n\nRealistic Grain\nExposureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grain is carefully researched and realistic, unlike the digital speckles rendered by other software. Like actual grain, it clumps and is strongest in the midtones. Grain size scales with your image size, just like real photographic enlargement.\n\nNon-Destructive Editing\nExposure supports a non-destructive worklflow, making experimentation easy. Effects in Photoshop are rendered on a new layer, leaving your original image untouched. In Photoshop, Exposure can be run as a Smart Filter for easy tweaking of the effect after it is created. Batch processing is supported with actions in Photoshop and through tight integration in Lightroom.\n\nMultithreaded\nExposure takes advantage of multiple processors and multiple cores in order to run fast on modern computers. The more cores, the faster Exposure runs.\n\nHuge Range of Effects\nThe best way to see what Exposure can do is to check out our examples, videos, and try it yourself for free.
