Our vision is to reach millions of people, and if this is the way God chooses to do it, then we are just going to be thankful and grateful for whatever He does. I pray that these songs will give something to people's hearts&quot;.\n\n&quot;When we step on the stage, we focus on the Lord - we don't focus on the praises of man. As we step onstage we want people to know that we are intimately involved with our Savior, and that ultimately we are not there to entertain them - we are there to worship Him together.&quot;\n\nMatt Glider / keyboards - 1) Goal for the Body of Christ: &quot;Our calling is also definitely to lead the body of Christ into worship. When God is lifted up, He draws men to Himself. &quot;We're aiming at the body of Christ and bringing people into a new place of worship, maybe somewhere they haven't been before. We try to stretch the audience and get them to dig deeper It's hard to imgaine worshipping and having God show up in the room and people not being changed.&quot;\n\n2) Goal concerning those who are searching: &quot;We don't have a big agenda. We just hear story after story from people that we meet each night. We've been doing this long enough to know that at each event, on each night, there is probably someone there who is at the end of their rope. People are hungry to know God, and if HE can use us to help lead those people to His throne, that's what we are called to do. We want to lead people into a deeptime of worship and intimacy before God.&quot;\n\nChad Jarnagin / lead vocalist: &quot;We want to challenge believers to get to that place of awakening in worship where they just don't sing about God on a horizontal level but truly sing to Him. Our desire for the band is to have awakenings all across the country, that the Spirit really would move when we lead worship. \n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ec164a8dc6028f0d508dedc5525b2c8a0847871","amp;dn":"Among+Thorns+Discography+1999-2002+%284+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ec164a8dc6028f0d508dedc5525b2c8a0847871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,193,100,168,220,96,40,240,213,8,222,220,85,37,178,200,160,132,120,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
