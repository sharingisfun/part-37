Without overdubs, his playing weaves together melody, counter-melody, bass, harmony, rhythm, and cross-rhythms is such a way as to give the feeling of various instruments playing together. Using a broad palette of techniques and timbre, and driven by a unique sense of composition, his intricate guitar pieces begin to take the listener beyond the instrument into a complex tapestry of sound.\n\nWhat follows is a collection of his albums (mostly from the first part of his career). Preparing this torrent today, I read in the FAQ section of his site that some of these albums are unavailable in music stores (!).\n\nSo enjoy these &quot;unexpected&quot; rarities.\n\n_____________________________\n\nalex de grassi - 1978 - turning  turning back\nalex de grassi - 1991 - deep at night\nalex de grassi - 1992 - a windham hill retrospective\nalex de grassi - 1998 - the water garden\nalex de grassi - altiplano\nalex de grassi - beyond the night sky\nalex de grassi - clockwork\nalex de grassi - slow circle\nalex de grassi - southern exposure\n\n\t\n\n*****************************\n\nPETER FINGER\n\nPeter Finger is a german guitarist, also founder of the label Acoustic Guitar.\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.acousticguitar.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.acousticguitar.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.peter-finger.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.peter-finger.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHis music springs from the French atmospheres 'a la Debussy' with a strong use of chromatic scales...\nHis style mixes classic music, rock, jazz, blues, celtic in a unique manner...\n\n[...] quand un poeme exquis amene les larmes au bord des yeux, ces larmes ne sont pas la preuve d'un exces de jouissances, elles sont bien plutot le temoignage d'une melanconie irritee, d'une postulation des nerfs, d'une nature exilee dans l'imparfait et qui voudrait s'emparer immediatement, sur cette terre meme, d'un paradis rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©.\n                              Charles Baudelaire &quot;Notes nouvelles sur Edgar Poe&quot; \n\n(when an exquisite poem brings one's eyes to the point of tears, those tears are not evidence of an excess of joy, they are witness far more to an exacerbated melancholy, a disposition of the nerves, a nature exiled among imperfect things, which would like to possess, without delay, a paradise revealed on this very same earth.)\n\n\nEnjoy this collection of albums from his discography\n\n______________________\n\n\nPeter Finger - Between the Lines\nPeter Finger - The Colours of the Night\nPeter Finger - Open Strings\nPeter Finger - Windspiele\nPeter Finger - Blue Moon\nPeter Finger - Niemansland\nPeter Finger - Solo\n\n\t\t\n*****************************\n\nDAVEY GRAHAM\n\nDavid Michael Gordon Graham, known as Davey Graham (originally Davy Graham), is a guitarist who is one of the most influential figures in the folk music revolution in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.
