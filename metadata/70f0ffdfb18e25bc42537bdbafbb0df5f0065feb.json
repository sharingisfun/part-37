At the heart of a Europe that has known peace for three quarters of a century, stands Metropolis, capital of the Franco-German Interland, the symbol of reconciliation. La Belle Epoque never ended. Scientific optimism and Imperial power ensure the prosperity of the continent, and now, preparations are being made for the conquest of space under the auspices of Albert Einstein... But for Inspector Gabriel Faune and the highest authorities of Metropolis, the future is not set in stone.
