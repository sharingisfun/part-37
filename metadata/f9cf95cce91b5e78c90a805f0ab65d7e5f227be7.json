Not because they're redefining the style's sound, but because their music is defined by so many of emo's nearly clichÃƒÂ© tendencies. A gerund-led band name? Check. Cryptically bittersweet titles like &quot;Little Devotional&quot;? Present and accounted for. Shouty, anthemic vocals, string-driven ballads like &quot;New American Classic,&quot; and wordy, confessional lyrics (&quot;Give me a chance? Whatever...you're so hit or miss, and that's so '93&quot;) are all in place as well. However, while Where You Want to Be might be more than a little (stereo)typical, it's not embarrassing; songs like &quot;A Decade Under the Influence,&quot; &quot;One Eighty by Summer,&quot; and &quot;Number Five With a Bullet&quot; do have some real impact, and show some songwriting growth since Tell All Your Friends. But since the band doesn't take the occasionally cringe-worthy risks of some of their emo brethren, Taking Back Sunday sometimes comes off as less than distinctive, and the album can sound like a generic soundtrack to generic teenage angst; even though it's a nearly universal subject, it should never sound routine. Where You Want to Be is definitely a solid album -- especially considering that it was recorded so soon after half the band was replaced -- but crafting something a little more unique would take Taking Back Sunday's music that much farther. [Where You Want to Be was released with a bonus CD of songs and videos from like-minded Victory Records artists, including Hawthorne Heights, Bayside, Action Action, and Silverstein.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9cf95cce91b5e78c90a805f0ab65d7e5f227be7","amp;dn":"Taking+Back+Sunday+-+Where+You+Want+to+Be+%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9cf95cce91b5e78c90a805f0ab65d7e5f227be7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,207,149,204,233,27,94,120,201,10,128,95,10,182,93,126,95,34,123,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
