He split from his longtime band of drinking buddies, the Faces, became a full-time member of the Rolling Stones(taking Mick Taylor's recently vacated spot), and he released his second solo album, NOW LOOK. \n\nIt's pretty surprising that Wood even had time to put an album together, let alone one that was as strong as his debut, I'VE GOT MY OWN ALBUM TO DO. \n\nAlthough it's produced by soul singer Bobby Womack, NOW LOOK followed in the same loose rock 'n' roll direction as its predecessor. The album contains such ragged rock highlights as &quot;I Got Lost When I Found You&quot; (penned by Womack) and &quot;Breathe on Me,&quot; the latter containing backing vocals by Keith Richards.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
