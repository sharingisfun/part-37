Everything. Yet, in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many. With crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy, Brian Greene shows how a range of different ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmultiverseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ proposals emerges from theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgangers, each reading this sentence in a distant universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes, of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time, or one that might be hovering millimeters away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. Or, perhaps strangest of all, a multiverse made purely of math.\n\nGreene, one of our foremost physicists and science writers, takes us on a captivating exploration of these parallel worlds and reveals how much of realityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true nature may be deeply hidden within them. And, with his unrivaled ability to make the most challenging of material accessible and entertaining, Greene tackles the core question: How can fundamental science progress if great swaths of reality lie beyond our reach?\n\nSparked by GreeneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trademark wit and precision, The Hidden Reality is at once a far-reaching survey of cutting-edge physics and a remarkable journey to the very edge of realityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a journey grounded firmly in science and limited only by our imagination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9918c733cd9b1f688961d6ab0bb91416ceec5ea9","amp;dn":"The+Hidden+Reality+-+Parallel+Universes+and+the+Deep+Laws+of+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9918c733cd9b1f688961d6ab0bb91416ceec5ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,24,199,51,205,155,31,104,137,97,214,171,11,185,20,22,206,236,94,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
