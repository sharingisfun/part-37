Wandering the streets in frustration, he is recruited in the repossession of a car by a repo agent. After discovering his parents have donated his college fund to a televangelist, he joins the repossession agency (Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation) as an apprentice &quot;repo man&quot;. During his training, he is introduced into the mercenary and paranoid world of the drivers, befriended by a UFO conspiracy theorist, confronted by rival repo agents, discovers some of his one-time friends have turned to a life of crime, is lectured to near cosmic unconsciousness by the repo agency grounds worker, and finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue concerning a huge repossession bounty on a 1964 Chevy Malibu driven by a lunatic government scientist, with Top Secret cargo in the trunk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:490b68fe244b71e1f84831c185e76fabc377c78b","amp;dn":"Repo+Man+1984+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"490b68fe244b71e1f84831c185e76fabc377c78b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,11,104,254,36,75,113,225,248,72,49,193,133,231,111,171,195,119,199,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
