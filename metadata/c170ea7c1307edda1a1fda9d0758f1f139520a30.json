Acrobat 9 Pro also offers users a dramatically overhauled form creation tool; a streamlined, interactive document review process; synchronized document views; powerful redaction tools, and more.\nAcrobat Pro Extended (formerly Adobe Acrobat 3D Version 8) offers Windows users added functionality, such as new 3D capabilities, PDF mapping features, video conversion tools, native support for Flash technology (so users can include video, animations, and applications in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader PDF files), and Adobe Presenter, which lets users create interactive presentations with PowerPoint and then publish them to PDF.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\n\n\nvisit me on facebook -  just Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot; and u will get it.!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c170ea7c1307edda1a1fda9d0758f1f139520a30","amp;dn":"Adobe+Acrobat+9+Classroom+in+a+Book%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c170ea7c1307edda1a1fda9d0758f1f139520a30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,112,234,124,19,7,237,218,26,31,218,157,7,88,241,241,57,82,10,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
