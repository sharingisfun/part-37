While commentators tend to review this work in isolation from his writing on political economy, Richard Morgan argues that although The Wealth of Nations is concerned with political economy, Smith's pointed attacks on exploitation and greed reflect the ethics outlined in his first work and illuminate the constructive role he proposed for government.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nPreface by Ian M.
