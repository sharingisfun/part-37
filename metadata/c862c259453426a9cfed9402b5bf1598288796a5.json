In this richly illustrated book, each species entry proceeds by season, explaining in nontechnical language how the birds nests, mates, and rears its brood in spring to how the bird survives in winter. Each bird's evolutionary adaptations, place in culture history, and name origin also appear. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c862c259453426a9cfed9402b5bf1598288796a5","amp;dn":"Birds+of+Forest+Yard%2C+and+Thicket","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c862c259453426a9cfed9402b5bf1598288796a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,98,194,89,69,52,38,169,207,237,148,2,181,191,21,152,40,135,150,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
