I've been keeping an eye open for it, and I will be including that Alexis Spight album in this 13th bundle for Clardx1 today.  Likewise, I am also including Andy Mineo's new &quot;Heroes For Sale&quot; for WallySlam.\n\nFor anyone interested, this is the way it works.  I torrent all of my 2013 music as soon as I get it.  Unless, of course, if there's an abundance of it, and it won't fit in my current bundle.  So if you're looking for a particular 2013 release, please know that I would be sharing it, if I had it.\n\nBut that's not to say I don't make notes of 2013 requests, such as Clardx1's and WallySlam's.  The truth is, I keep pretty good notes.  I am still looking for a copy of Deon Kipping's album for shaund0.  Damanyal is looking for Hart Ramsey.  Scorp804, ITFPB, and littleredcorvet all want the new Kurt Carr album.  Jailroll is hoping to see the latest Purified.  And Fred Hammond's latest album will in fact be included in my 14th bundle for littleredcorvet.  It didn't fit in this 13th bundle today.\n\nSo, speaking of today's bundle, our year-to-date total for 2013 up to 373 releases.\n\nThis 13th bundle includes the following 26 titles...\n\n * 3 Days Leave - 2013 - Rebuild My Heart - Single\n * Afters, The - 2013 - Life is Beautiful\n * Alexis Spight - 2013 - L.O.L. - Living Out Loud\n * Amy Grant - 2013 - Don't Try So Hard - Single\n * Andy Mineo - 2013 - Heroes For Sale\n * Benea Reach - 2013 - Possession\n * Benjamin Brainard - 2013 - A Beautiful Inheritance\n * Bobby Bishop And Lukus Simari - 2013 - This Is Life\n * Calm The Sea - 2013 - Calm The Sea\n * Carlos Whittaker - 2013 - In The Arms - Single\n * David Andrew - 2013 - Rest\n * Evangel - 2013 - Eyewitness Encounters\n * Fallstar - 2013 - Backdraft\n * Maranatha Music - 2013 - Top 25 Gospel Songs\n * Maranatha Music - 2013 - Top 25 Praise Songs\n * Melvillous - 2013 - Undeserving\n * North Point Kids - 2013 - Shine\n * RichRhymes - 2013 - XLFE\n * Rock Music, The - 2013 - Sow EP\n * Shai Linne - 2013 - Lyrical Theology Pt 1 Theology\n * Shane And Shane - 2013 - Bring Your Nothing\n * Shirley Caesar - 2013 - Good God\n * Silverline - 2013 - Lights Out\n * Various - 2013 - Love Never Fails\n * We Came As Romans -2013 -  Hope - Single\n * We Came As Romans -2013 -  King of Silence - Single\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:308f3ce7a12ff5c0dadc5984b4361039c86955c9","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+13%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"308f3ce7a12ff5c0dadc5984b4361039c86955c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,143,60,231,161,47,245,192,218,220,89,132,180,54,16,57,200,105,85,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
