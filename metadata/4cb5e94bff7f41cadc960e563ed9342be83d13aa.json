A decade-long celebration of growth and power, fueled by the victory in WWII. Based on Pulitzer Prize winner David Halberstam's bestselling book, this lively series casts a nostalgic eye back on the years of Ozzie and Harriet and the Hula Hoop, years which nonetheless paved the way for the turmoil of the decades to follow. From Sputnik to Elvis, bobby-socks to the Kinsey Report, DAVID HALBERSTAM'S THE FIFTIES is a breathtaking collage of the people, music, memories, fads and issues that sent the first Baby Boomers on their way. Countless interviews, clips from landmark TV shows and movies and specially-produced music videos set to original '50's hits capture the intense tapestry of optimism and fear, repression and discovery that was THE FIFTIES.\n\n\nEpisode 7 - The Road To The Sixties\n\nIn the final episode, Americans are on the move as car sales and road construction soar, but the nation's self-confidence is shaken when the Soviet Union launches Sputnik and Fidel Castro rises to power in Cuba. A few setbacks can't keep us down for long, though, as fast cars, fast food and the space race hurtle the country into the next decade and forever leave behind a time known simply as, &quot;The Fifties&quot;. Hope you all enjoy the series!\n\n\nVideo \nVHSRip\nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : 2 \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263) \nCodec ID : DX50 \nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 5 \nDuration : 54mn 30s \nBit rate : 3 510 Kbps \nWidth : 640 pixels \nHeight : 480 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nCompression mode : Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.381 \nStream size : 1.34 GiB (95%) \nWriting library : XviD 73 \n\nAudio \nID : 1 \nFormat : MPEG Audio \nFormat version : Version 1 \nFormat profile : Layer 3 \nMode : Joint stereo \nCodec ID : 55 \nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nDuration : 54mn 30s \nSource duration : 54mn 30s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 192 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 74.9 MiB (5%) \nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 33 ms (1.00 video frame) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cb5e94bff7f41cadc960e563ed9342be83d13aa","amp;dn":"History+Channel+-+David+Halberstam%27s+The+Fifties+%281997%29+-+Pt.+7+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cb5e94bff7f41cadc960e563ed9342be83d13aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,181,233,75,255,127,65,202,220,150,14,86,62,217,52,43,232,61,19,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
