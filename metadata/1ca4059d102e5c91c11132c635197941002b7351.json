US rock duo the Black Keys also return to the show to perform a couple of tracks from their upcoming eighth album Turn Blue which sees Danger Mouse return to producing duties. American soul and funk band Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings also perform. Their recent album Give the People What They Want was delayed when Jones was diagnosed with Stage II pancreatic cancer. She has completed her treatment and has bounced back with a vengeance. Making his solo debut on the show after performances with many of his other groups is Damon Albarn, playing some numbers from his Everyday Robots LP. Completing the line up is Sahrawi singer Aziza Brahim, born in 1976 in a refugee camp in the western part of the Sahara desert.
