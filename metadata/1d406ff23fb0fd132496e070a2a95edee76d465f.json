The college-age church group plans to go to Manila and help victims of the sex-trafficking industry. Stone's lingering nightmare memories about the sex-trafficking industry have him warning church leaders that the trip is a bad idea. He knows all too well that it could end in violence, and those involved aren't to be trifled with.\n\nWhen beautiful Wren Morgan goes missing, he has a sick feeling that he knows exactly who took her, and for what purpose. The problem is, Wren isn't just any other student. She's someone he's close to, someone he cares about. Now she's in the hands of cruel, evil men, and Stone is the only one who can rescue her before the unthinkable happens\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d406ff23fb0fd132496e070a2a95edee76d465f","amp;dn":"Jack+Wilder%2C+The+Missionary+2013+epub+mobi+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d406ff23fb0fd132496e070a2a95edee76d465f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,64,111,242,63,176,253,19,36,150,224,112,162,169,94,222,231,109,70,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
