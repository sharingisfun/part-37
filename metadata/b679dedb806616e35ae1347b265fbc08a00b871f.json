The war was so devastating that it set technological progress back by decades if not centuries, which is why the settings donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look futuristic. Although the world is now at peace, there continues to be distrust between the Sphere Kingdom (Moon) and the Earth Federation. Travel between the two is restricted for diplomatic purposes and confined to a single spaceport on Earth.\n\nSo anyway, one day the lunar princess, Feena fam Earthlight, comes to the main characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house for home stayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n(copied from VNDB, because lazy.)\n\nInstructions:\n\nMount/burn and install.\n\nApply the official 1.2 fix patch.\n\nRun the No-DVD patch provided. Target the reg.exe file in the game's base directory.\n\nInstall english patch.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b679dedb806616e35ae1347b265fbc08a00b871f","amp;dn":"Yoake+Mae+Yori+Ruri+Iro+na+-Brighter+than+dawning+blue-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b679dedb806616e35ae1347b265fbc08a00b871f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,121,222,219,128,102,22,227,90,225,52,123,38,95,188,8,160,11,135,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
