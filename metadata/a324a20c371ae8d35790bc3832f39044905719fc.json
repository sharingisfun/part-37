Emancipator's debut album Soon It Will Be Cold Enough, a wintry mix of intricate beats and atmospheric textures featuring violinist Cindy Kao and guest vocalist Thao Nguyen, was self-released in 2006, later re-released by Japanese label Hyde Out Recordings in 2008. Appling made his live debut in 2009 opening for Bonobo, and toured Japan the same year. Second album Safe in the Steep Cliffs arrived in 2010, featuring increased live instrumentation and more ambitious arrangements and programming. Remixes, featuring reworked versions of Emancipator tracks by Blockhead, Big Gigantic, and others, was released in 2011. Appling founded his own label Loci Records in 2012, releasing music by friends such as Tor and StÃ¨v. Dusk to Dawn, Emancipator's third album and first to feature violin from frequent live collaborator Ilya Goldberg, was released by Loci Records in 2013. Appling continued touring with a full-band, Emancipator Ensemble, often co-headlining festivals with artists such as Pretty Lights and ODESZA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a324a20c371ae8d35790bc3832f39044905719fc","amp;dn":"Emancipator+-+Seven+Seas+%282015%29+%5B16.44+CD+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a324a20c371ae8d35790bc3832f39044905719fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,36,162,12,55,26,232,211,87,144,188,56,50,243,144,68,144,87,25,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
