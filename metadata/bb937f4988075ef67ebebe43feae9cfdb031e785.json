First published way back in 1948 it contains hundreds of damaging admissions and revealing statements from Zionists, anti-Zionists and disinterested parties. Quote after quote from all kinds of people that were involved into the formation of Israel, many predicted the slaughter that would inevitably follow. The Palestine Plot is simply an unique book that explains history by quoting people and documents most have never heard of, probably because they strip naked many of the lies penetrated by Zionism in order to achieve world dominance. 150 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb937f4988075ef67ebebe43feae9cfdb031e785","amp;dn":"Jensen-Palestine+Plot+%28quote+history+of+zionism%29%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb937f4988075ef67ebebe43feae9cfdb031e785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,147,127,73,136,7,94,246,126,190,190,67,254,174,156,253,176,49,231,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
