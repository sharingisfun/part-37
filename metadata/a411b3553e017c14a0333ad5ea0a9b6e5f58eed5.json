Plenty of topical and amazing gags, several arguments about football, some fairly merciless banter, a chat about all the funny and crazy things youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen and done that week Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and of course, a frank discussion about the beauty and general awesomeness of women. Fortunately, such a magazine exists. ZOO, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best selling menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weekly magazine, is all about the things that bring men together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all those things that we are proud to say make us normal blokes.\n\nZOO -  UK   Issue 514, 20 February 2014\nBook Language: English \nPages: 70\nFile Type: Pdf\nFile Size: 46.90 MB\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KqIdYx7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KqIdYx7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/KqIdYx7.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a411b3553e017c14a0333ad5ea0a9b6e5f58eed5","amp;dn":"ZOO+UK+-+Issue+514%2C+20+February+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a411b3553e017c14a0333ad5ea0a9b6e5f58eed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,17,179,85,62,1,124,20,160,51,58,213,234,10,155,110,95,88,238,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
