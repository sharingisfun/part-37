Prejudice 5:29\n02. You Must Run 7:28\n03. All Things Are Fading 5:08\n04. Diluvium 17:44\nBonus:\n05. Thunderstorm 4:58\n06. Diluvium (Inst.) 17:48\n\nMusicians:\nWilly KlÃƒÂ¼ter - organ, lead vocals\nWolfgang Netzer - guitar, bass, backing vocals\nMichael KlÃƒÂ¼ter - drums\n\nAinigma, which hailed from Germany, only produced one album titled &quot;Diluvium.&quot; Unfortunate that is, because they had much potential for a wider audience than what they got during the year this was finished, which was 1973. The use of organ is very prevalent in their recordings. Their sound has a Krautrock/ psych/ spacerock atmosphere, and is often very gloomy and dramatic. It is clear that Ainigma liked to make long jam sessions when hearing their tracks. A good album to listen to while in the midst of deep thought, in my opinion.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cff9da4477a89343a483710e724e9974bac5e2ba","amp;dn":"Aingma+-+Diluvium+%281973%2F2006%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cff9da4477a89343a483710e724e9974bac5e2ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,249,218,68,119,168,147,67,164,131,113,14,114,78,153,116,186,197,226,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
