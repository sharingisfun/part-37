Her lonely life over, she was soon married with two small children. But things in the Templeton household were never quite what they seemed.\r\n\r\nNow approaching 70, and increasingly a burden on the children sheâ€™s never felt close to, Audrey plans a once-in-a-lifetime cruise around the Greek isles. Forcing twins Lexi and John along for the ride, the Templetons set sail as a party of three â€“ but only two will return.\r\n\r\nOn the night of her birthday, Audrey goes missingâ€¦hours after she breaks the news that the twins stand to inherit a fortune after her death. As the search of the ship widens, so does the list of suspects â€“ and with dark clues emerging about Audreyâ€™s early life, the twins begin to question if they can even trust one anotherâ€¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da98e47bf19b02f491f57d8d461f20d5b722304d","amp;dn":"The+Disappearance+-+Annabel+Kantaria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da98e47bf19b02f491f57d8d461f20d5b722304d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,152,228,123,241,155,2,244,145,245,125,141,70,31,32,213,183,34,48,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
