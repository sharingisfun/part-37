The game is set to be released on May 31, 2011. [1] It contains elements of The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims: House Party, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: University, and The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff. In The Sims 3: Generations, each life phase has a theme. For children, imagination and make-believe are key themes. For teens, rebellious, chaotic scenes such as parties and pranks are an addition. As a young adult and adult, the focus is on their relationships with others; from getting married to having children of their own. Elders get to enjoy their time reminiscing about the golden years and the joys of watching their grandchildren grow up.\n\nDeveloper(s)\tEA Play/The Sims Studio (Windows, Mac OS X)\nPublisher(s)\tElectronic Arts\nSeries\tThe Sims\nVersion\t6.2\nPlatform(s)\tWindows,\nRelease date(s)\t\nNA May 31, 2011\nEU June 1, 2011\nGenre(s)\tLife simulation game\nMode(s)\tSingle-player\nRating(s)\t\nESRB: T\n\n&lt;&lt;For Windows Not mac&gt;&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56afd0016b6561d21b993c77262fafe510b6fdfa","amp;dn":"The+Sims+3+Generations+%5BMULTI20%5D%5BPCDVD%5D%5BRELOADED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56afd0016b6561d21b993c77262fafe510b6fdfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,175,208,1,107,101,97,210,27,153,60,119,38,47,175,229,16,182,253,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
