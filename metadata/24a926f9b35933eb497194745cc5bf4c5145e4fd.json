It is said that if Jimmy Smith was the Charlie Parker of jazz organ, Larry Young was its John Coltrane.\n\nLarry Young started out heavily Jimmy Smith influenced. After some time John Coltrane's modal approach influenced Young, and in 1965 Young recorded what is considered to be his greatest album: Unity.\n\nHe then ventured further into avant-garde and fusion where he recorded with e.g. Carlos Santana, John McLaughlin, Miles Davis and Jimi Hendrix. His hard lifestyle soon took its toll though, and he died at only 37 years of age.\n\nThis cherry-picked Larry Young collection, with Young as leader or sideman, emphasize Young's early to mid-1960s period, but it also stretches into avant-garde and fusion. This means that you will find a few records here that are very, very different from each other, e.g. 'Testifying' vs 'Emergency!'.\n\nMy criteria when choosing which albums to include in this collection:\n1) Prioritize early to mid-1960s albums.\n2) Include only albums where Larry Young play the bass lines himself at the organ.\n\nList of included albums in cronological recorded order:\n\n1960 Larry Young - Testifying\n1962 Larry Young - Groove Street\n1964 Grant Green - Talkin' About \n1964 Larry Young - Into Somethin'\n1964 Grant Green - Street Of Dreams\n1965 Grant Green - I Want To Hold Your Hand\n1965 Grant Green - His Majesty King Funk\n1965 Larry Young - Unity\n1968 Larry Young - Heaven On Earth\n1969 Larry Young - Mother Ship\n1969 Tony Williams - Emergency!\n1977 Joe Chambers - Double Exposure\n\nAn in-depth article about Larry Young is also included:\n'Larry Young's Tragic Genius', by Guy Sterling, 2003.\n\n----------\n\nMP3 format.
