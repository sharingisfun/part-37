But when a bomb goes off in the Bonwit Teller Department Store the police go insane trying to figure out what&amp;#039;s going on. Soon, a man named Simon calls and asks for McClane. Simon tells Inspector Walter Cobb that McClane is going to play a game called &quot;Simon Says&quot;. He says that McClane is going to do the tasks he assigns him. If not, he&amp;#039;ll blow off another bomb. With the help of a Harlem electrician, John McClane must race all over New York trying to figure out the frustrating puzzles that the crafty terrorist gives him. But when a bomb goes off in a subway station right by the Federal Reserve (the biggest gold storage in the world) things start to get heated up. Written by SARSman1793\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ John McClane (Willis) is back and is facing one of his greatest challenges yet. It&amp;#039;s New York City and an individual, known only as &amp;#039;Simon&amp;#039; (Irons). He has planted explosive devices in different locations of the city, and the only way for McClane to stop them is to follow what Simon says. Dragging Zeus (Jackson) into the problem, McClane must solve every riddle that Simon gives and get to each bomb before it goes off. Written by Film_Fan\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A man calling himself &quot;Simon&quot; begins a reign of terror in the streets of New York: he threatens to detonate bombs around the city unless Detective John McClane cooperates in a game of &quot;Simon Says&quot;. McClane has a bad hangover and a bad attitude, and isn&amp;#039;t in the mood for games, especially this one.

But he&amp;#039;s quickly put back on the force because of a man named Simon (Irons) who has set bombs all over the city and gives McClane the challenge of finding them before the go off. McClane is aided by a Harlem store owner named Zeus Carver (Jackson). Written by Ridley Lavine\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Things aren&amp;#039;t going well for John McClane: his marriage is breaking up, he&amp;#039;s been suspended from the force and now the brother of Hans Gruber, the German terrorist he threw off a building a few years back, is threatening to blow up a school if McClane doesn&amp;#039;t run around the city solving his demeaning and dangerous puzzles. With the help of Zeus, a Harlem electrician, McClane discovers Gruber&amp;#039;s plot to distract the NYPD while he clears the federal bank of billions of dollars of gold.

This throws the NYPD into a frenzy, trying to sort out what&amp;#039;s going on. At the station, Inspector Walter Cobb of the NYPD&amp;#039;s major case unit gets a call from a man who calls himself Simon. Simon asks for Lieutenant John McClane, and Walter tells Simon that John, who is now an alcoholic, is on suspension. Simon wants John to go to the corner of 138th Street and Amsterdam in Harlem and wear a racist sign. Walter and his fellow officers Joe Lambert, Connie Kowalski, and Ricky Walsh find John, who is now an alcoholic who is seperated from his wife Holly, and they talk to him. Ricky tells Walter that there have been 3 killings in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn in the past two nights, and 14 dump trucks were stolen from a construction yard on Staten Island. John wants to know where the backup is going to be, and Walter tells him that the backup will be on 128th Street, 10 blocks away. John complains that 10 blocks is too far away for the backup to be. Walter tells John that Simon has threatened to detonate another bomb if the police don&amp;#039;t do what he says. John wants to know why he&amp;#039;s been targeted by Simon, but no one knows why. While John is in Harlem, store owner Zeus Carver rescues John from a black street gang that was beating John up because of the sign. John and Zeus find themselves stuck with each other as Simon continues his antics and forces John and Zeus to work together to do what he tells them, but John and Zeus can&amp;#039;t stop one of Simon&amp;#039;s bombs from blowing up a subway station, and it turns out that Simon is Simon Peter Gruber the brother of Hans Gruber, the terrorist that John rescued the Nakatomi building from in Los Angeles years ago. The question now is, is this about revenge on John, or is Simon planning something a lot bigger?
