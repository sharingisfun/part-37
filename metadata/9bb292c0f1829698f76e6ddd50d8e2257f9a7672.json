The illustrations in this survey of the development of the cat and its special relationship with people over 7,000 years are drawn mainly from the collections of the British and Natural History Museums, both rich in cat imagery from many cultures and civilizations. This book looks at the different roles cats have played in human life and also describes the various modern pedigree breeds - from short-haired tabby to long-haired Persian - which have evolved from the original wild cat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bb292c0f1829698f76e6ddd50d8e2257f9a7672","amp;dn":"The+British+Museum+Book+of+Cats-Ancient+and+Modern+%28Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bb292c0f1829698f76e6ddd50d8e2257f9a7672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,178,146,192,241,130,150,152,247,110,109,221,80,216,226,37,127,154,118,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
