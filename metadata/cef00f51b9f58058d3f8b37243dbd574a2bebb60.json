Now he's taking on his toughest assignment: Britain.\r\nA large part of Kemp's success as a journalist has been his sheer ballsiness - say what you will, but there is no denying the man is brave. \r\nIn this new three part series; Ross Kemp explores three of the most challenging problems facing contemporary Britain - immigration, child sexual exploitation and alcohol abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Immigration \r\nThe actor explores some of the most challenging issues facing Britain, beginning by setting out to separate the reality from the rhetoric on the subject of immigration. Ross finds out who exactly is coming to Britain, how they are getting into the country and just what they are entitled to once they arrive, and also hears from those who have made dangerous journeys to the UK and finds out what the Government is doing to tackle the situation.\r\n\r\n2)  Child Sexual Exploitation \r\nThe actor explores the disturbing extent of child abuse in the UK, with one in four children sharing sexual images or videos of themselves as well as a growing number addicted to pornography and many having been sexually abused. He meets someone who was encouraged from the age of 12 to perform explicit sex acts on camera to be viewed online and also hears from a former gang member who describes how some gangs entice girls with drink, drugs and presents in order to use them for sex.\r\n\r\n3)  Alcohol Abuse \r\nThe actor explores the nation's drinking habits, looking at the impact of alcohol on the individual as well as society as a whole. Ross's investigation starts on call with a paramedic in Sunderland as he examines what the UK's drink-obsessed culture is costing the ambulance services, hospitals and the police, and also learns the price of social drinking when he meets those whose habits have cost them their friends, family and almost their live.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/94/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f7/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/43/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8f/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/Ross-Britain-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3122 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 978 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/d2yd27/ross-kemps-britain/episodeguide/series-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cef00f51b9f58058d3f8b37243dbd574a2bebb60","amp;dn":"Ross+Kemps+Britain+Series+1+1of3+Immigration+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cef00f51b9f58058d3f8b37243dbd574a2bebb60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,240,15,81,185,245,128,88,211,248,179,114,67,219,213,116,162,190,187,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
