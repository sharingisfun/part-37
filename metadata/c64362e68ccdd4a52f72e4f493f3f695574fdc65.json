Wheels arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t being reinvented on this four piece EP, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a dead honest approach to the music which quite obviously is flowing through these guysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s veins. The band have no apparent connection to any scene, hence, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no expectations of a sound to live up to for them, no asses to kiss for acceptance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which in all its simplicity makes this record so god damn good. It gives them the freedom to create exactly what it is that they want.\n\nTheir sound is obviously influenced a great deal by Hot Water Music, which is fabulous, in my opinion, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so much originality in this sound (not to mention the songs are written in their mother tongue; Norwegian) that comparing them simply to HWM wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do them proper justice. Lyrically heartfelt, melodically feel good and wonderfully honest in its approach. Thanks guys, for making me feel this way about punk rock again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been quite some time! \n\nTracklist;\n\n01. Jeg Reiser Meg\n02. En KirkegÃƒÂ¥rd Av DrÃƒÂ¸mmer\n03. Landgang\n04.
