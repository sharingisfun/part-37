It was released in the Benelux and Germany on June 1 and in the United Kingdom and France on June 4, 2012, by CNR Music, who took over Delain when Warner Music refused to release We Are the Others. The first single, &quot;Get the Devil Out of Me&quot;, was released on April 13. The second single &quot;We Are The Others&quot; and its video was released on September 11, 2012. This is the only album by Delain without any studio songs with guest vocalist Marco Hietala. Live versions of &quot;The Gathering&quot; and &quot;Control the Storm&quot; are featured on the special edition of the album with Marco singing his parts live.History\n\nDuring their 2011 live shows, Delain debuted three new songs from the album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Manson&quot; (which was later renamed to &quot;Mother Machine&quot;), &quot;Get the Devil Out of Me&quot; and &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;.\n\nIn an interview with Sonic Cathedral, vocalist Charlotte Wessels discussed the inspiration she drew from the Sophie Lancaster case:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \tI remember when I first heard about it Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t on Dutch news, I just heard about it through Internet networks and the goth scene Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ there was this movie made about it, a short film of about four minutes. I saw it, and I just cried. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so incredibly sad! After seeing the movie, I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really DO anything with it until we were working on Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Are The Others.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But the basic idea of the lyrics was there. It was just supposed to be a song about Ã¢â‚¬Å“we are the othersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a feeling of togetherness. On the one hand, being proud of whoever you are, whether you divert from the norm in whatever way you divert from the norm. But on the other hand, it is also kind of a song for Ã¢â‚¬Å“othersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. We just wanted a song about acceptance. \tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Charlotte Wessels, SonicCathedral.com interview\n\nOriginally intended for release in early 2012, the album's release date was unknown after Warner Music's purchase of Roadrunner Records but it was announced via a Facebook message on the band official page that the album would be released on the 1st June 2012 with the album's first single, &quot;Get the Devil Out of Me&quot;, being released on 13 April 2012. The song was released for listening online on April 3 on their official website. The second single from the album was announced as the title track, &quot;We Are the Others&quot;, and a music video was filmed.\nTrack listing\n\nAll lyrics by Charlotte Wessels and Charlotte Wessels/Tripod\nNo. \tTitle \tMusic \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Mother Machine&quot;   \tMartijn Westerholt, Charlotte Wessels, Guus Eikens, Tripod \t4:34\n2. \t&quot;Electricity&quot;   \tWesterholt, Wessels, Eikens, Tripod \t4:14\n3. \t&quot;We Are the Others&quot;   \tWesterholt, Wessels, Tripod \t3:17\n4. \t&quot;Milk and Honey&quot;   \tWesterholt, Wessels, Eikens, Tripod \t4:26\n5. \t&quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot;   \tWesterholt, Wessels, Eikens, Tripod \t3:59\n6. \t&quot;I Want You&quot;   \tWessels, Eikens, Tripod \t4:52\n7. \t&quot;Where Is the Blood&quot;   \tWesterholt, Wessels, Eikens, Tripod \t3:16\n8. \t&quot;Generation Me&quot;   \tWesterholt, Wessels, Tripod \t3:43\n9. \t&quot;Babylon&quot;   \tWesterholt, Wessels, Eikens, Tripod \t4:06\n10. \t&quot;Are You Done with Me&quot;   \tWessels, Eikens, Tripod \t3:05\n11. \t&quot;Get the Devil Out of Me&quot;   \tWesterholt, Wessels, Eikens, Tripod \t3:21\n12. \t&quot;Not Enough&quot;   \tWesterholt, Wessels, Tripod \t4:43\n[show]Special edition bonus tracks \t\n[show]Japanese edition bonus track \t\nPersonnel\nDelain\n\n    Charlotte Wessels - vocals\n    Guus Eikens - rhythm guitars\n    Otto Schimmelpenninck van der Oije - bass\n    Martijn Westerholt - keyboards\n    Sander Zoer - drums\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n    Timo Somers - ambience and solo guitars\n    Oliver Philipps - ambience and solo guitars, keyboards and vocals arrangements\n    Henka Johansson - additional drums\n    Burton C.
