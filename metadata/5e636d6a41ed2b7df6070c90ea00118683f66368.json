Last performance of Walk On. \nThis is one of three shows scheduled to make up for the postponed show that was planned to take place on 4 April 2006 at Yokohama's Nissan Stadium. This is U2's first concert in Japan since March 1998.\n\n\nConcert review:\n\nFabulous night at Saitama. Flew down from Hong Kong for this one and the boys did not disappoint. \nFrom the beginning chords of Wake Up- Arcade Fire, the standard build up song before the band takes the stage, to the last chords of the magical One Tree Hill, the lucky crowd were taken through a back catalogue of some of U2's \nfinest songs. \n\nThe punters that showed up for this one were in good form - polite yet enthusiastic, dedicated yet respectful to others in the crowd. All that you really want when you are upfront and bopping away with the others.\n\nBono, ever the front man, led the troops in a soaring rendition of City of Blinding Lights, Vertigo and Elevation before hitting the old songs hard - wonderful versions of Sunday Bloody Sunday, Bullet the Blue Sky, Miss Sarajevo (with Bono even singing Pavarotti's italian part which was might impressive) and Bad was also thrown into the mix. \n\nThe main set led into 2 full encores of Achtung Baby hits - Fly and MW and then the classic With or Without You. Coming back for the 2nd, they played their single Saints before closing out again with my 2 favourite U2 songs - Angel of Harlem and OTH. \n\n\nMultiTracker @ FrankFoo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e636d6a41ed2b7df6070c90ea00118683f66368","amp;dn":"U2+-+2006-11-29+-+Saitama+-+Japanese+Skies+%28MP3%40320+kbps%29+%5BFrank","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e636d6a41ed2b7df6070c90ea00118683f66368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,99,109,106,65,237,43,125,246,7,12,144,234,0,17,134,131,246,99,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
