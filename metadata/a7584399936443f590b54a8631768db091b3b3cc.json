Readers are expected to have one or more videos available, which will be used during the exercises within this book.\n\nYear: 2012\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7584399936443f590b54a8631768db091b3b3cc","amp;dn":"HTML5+Video+How-to+-+2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7584399936443f590b54a8631768db091b3b3cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,88,67,153,147,100,67,245,144,181,74,134,49,118,141,176,145,179,179,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
