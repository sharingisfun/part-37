Nirvana: The Untold Stories is a documentary which charts the group&amp;#039;s unexpected rise to fame, as well as the troubled life and tragic death of guitarist and lead singer Kurt Cobain. Please note that Nirvana: The Untold Stories was created without the participation of the members of the group and features no music or performances by Nirvana. \n\n-Dockland","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b323f58156484b3821567fab17212c4687dc4a19","amp;dn":"Documentary.Nirvana.The.Untold.Stories.XVID-Dockland.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b323f58156484b3821567fab17212c4687dc4a19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,35,245,129,86,72,75,56,33,86,127,171,23,33,44,70,135,220,74,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
