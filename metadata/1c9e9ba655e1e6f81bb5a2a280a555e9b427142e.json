They explain how they go about creating their art, their iconic dress sense and their tricky relationships with the art establishment and the media.\r\nGilbert &amp; George have always pushed at the boundaries of art and society. Their pictures are provocative, disturbing and profoundly moving. Their art confronts life in the vibrant, seductive, tense London metropolis. This film is a fascinating insight into their world and an important document of their motivation and consequent art. &quot;We have inside ourselves a lot of thoughts, feelings, desires, dreams, hopes and fears. And we, as artists, have a great, burning ambitious need to tell these things and put these things out of ourselves&quot;.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Gilbert-and-George-Seventh-Art-DVD-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/Gilbert-and-George-Seventh-Art-DVD-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/70/Gilbert-and-George-Seventh-Art-DVD-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Gilbert-and-George-Seventh-Art-DVD-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Gilbert-and-George-Seventh-Art-DVD-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Gilbert-and-George-Seventh-Art-DVD-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/Gilbert-and-George-Seventh-Art-DVD-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/Gilbert-and-George-Seventh-Art-DVD-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ed/Gilbert-and-George-Seventh-Art-DVD-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21 (~1447Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 854x480\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 30000/1001 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.49 VBR 48KHz (~127Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 62 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 702 MB\r\n * Source: DVD\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.seventh-art.com/shop/tim-marlow-with-gilbert-george/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9e9ba655e1e6f81bb5a2a280a555e9b427142e","amp;dn":"Tim+Marlow+with+Gilbert+and+George+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9e9ba655e1e6f81bb5a2a280a555e9b427142e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,158,155,166,85,225,230,248,27,181,162,162,128,165,85,233,180,39,20,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
