Edmund Purdom is the nice Jewish boy who leaves his dear old dad and traipses off after her. (You'd have thought EP would have learned his lesson after traipsing off after Nefer Nefer Nefer (Bella Darvi) in &quot;The Egyptian&quot; the year before at Fox. But no!) Anyway, love waxes and wanes and the Syrian Empire seems - somehow - to hang in the balance. Oh, an a calf or two is fatted as well for a big homecoming scene.  Lots of fine MGM contract players (Louis Calhern, Francis Sullivan, Walter Hampden, James Mitchell) flounder about in some of the most awful costumes seen in an MGM epic. This cost $5 million (big money in those days) and was pretty much Lana's lavish &quot;tomb&quot; at MGM. She made one more loser and than MGM let her go. It's awful - but in a funny way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:884ada78a8ca87c99d449c201fa941b7ef3f73b1","amp;dn":"The+Prodigal+%281955%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"884ada78a8ca87c99d449c201fa941b7ef3f73b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,74,218,120,168,202,135,201,157,68,156,32,31,169,65,183,239,63,115,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
