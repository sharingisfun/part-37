The game allows the player to take on the role of a criminal\nwho can roam freely around a big city. Various missions are set for\ncompletion, such as bank robberies, assassinations, and other crimes.\n\nGTA: London 1969 is a mission pack for Grand Theft Auto, released April 29,\n1999 It takes place in London, in 1969, as the title implies. The player once\nagain enters the role of a criminal looking to work his way up the career\nladder of organized crime. The game uses the same game engine as Grand Theft\nAuto, thus giving the game graphics reminiscent of the aforementioned game,\nand the gameplay and game mechanics are also very much alike. Like Grand Theft\nAuto the mission pack is divided into sub-sections with short cutscenes in\nbetween.\n\nGTA: London 1961 is a second mission pack for Grand Theft Auto, and it\nrequires both Grand Theft Auto and GTA: London 1969 to be installed. It was\nreleased June 1, 1999. As the name implies, the game takes place in London in\nthe year 1961, eight years before the events that took place in GTA: London\n1969. The expansion includes new missions, 22 new vehicles, a new cutscene,\nand a new multiplayer deathmatch map based upon Manchester. The 1961 setting\nmakes this mission pack the earliest GTA game chronologically. GTA: London\n1961 seems to be the least known chapter in the Grand Theft Auto series,\nmost likely due to its inconspicuous download location and dependence\non word of mouth.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 2 was released on October 22, 1999. It is a sequel to the\noriginal Grand Theft Auto. It expanded on the top-down, open-ended crime\nworld gameplay formula with a host of new features including the advent of\nmultiple rival gangs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ seven, to be exact, including the Yakuza, Scientists,\nLooneys, Rednecks, Zaibatsu, the Russian Mob and Hare Krishnas. Earn your\nrespect with each gang. Reap the benefits with all manner of shady\nwork-for-hire gigs contracted your way. And climb your way to the\ntop of the criminal pile.\n\n\nThis torrent contains Grand Theft Auto, its mission packs: London 1969\nand London 1961, and Grand Theft Auto 2. Maps have been included for easier\nnavigation through the game. I also included Language Patch for GTA 2 which\nwill add Italian, German and French language support.
