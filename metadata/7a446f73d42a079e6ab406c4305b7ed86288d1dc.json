Now supporting Windows 7, WinZip 14 makes it easy to zip and unzip files for quick, efficient, and secure file transfer, email transmission, and data storage. Use it to open Zip, Zipx, RAR, 7Z, BZ2, CAB, JAR, IMG, and other compressed file types. Bundle related files together. Secure confidential data and automatically back it up.\n\n\nZIP (file format)\n\n\n\nThe ZIP file format is a data compression and archive format. A ZIP file contains one or more files that have been compressed to reduce file size, or stored as-is. The ZIP file format permits a number of compression algorithms, but as of 2009[update], the Deflate method continues to be dominant.[citation needed]\n\nThe format was originally created in 1986 by Phil Katz for PKZIP,[1] and evolved from the previous ARC compression format by Thom Henderson. The PKZIP format is now supported by many software utilities other than PKZIP (see List of file archivers). Microsoft has included built-in ZIP support (under the name &quot;compressed folders&quot;) in versions of its Windows operating system since 1998. Apple has included built-in ZIP support in Mac OS X 10.3 and later, including other compression formats.\n\nZIP files generally use the file extensions &quot;.zip&quot; or &quot;.ZIP&quot; and the MIME media type application/zip, although the ZIP file format has also been used by many programs, usually under a different name. Examples of this usage are Java JAR files, Mozilla Firefox Add-ons (.xpi), id Software .pk3/.pk4 files, Activity Bundles (.xo) for the Sugar learning platform, Winamp and Windows Media Player skins, OpenDocument format and Office Open XML.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a446f73d42a079e6ab406c4305b7ed86288d1dc","amp;dn":"WinZip+10+%2B+Working+keys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a446f73d42a079e6ab406c4305b7ed86288d1dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,68,111,115,212,42,7,158,106,180,6,196,48,91,126,216,98,136,209,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
