This may be the finest live reggae period and that includes marley and tosh. This is a full company of musicians playing more complex arraignments. Three piece brass combo and all the percussionists playing hypnotic reggae at it's best. The drummer here is a guy i had never heard of and he is just sick! Better than sly dunbar. He drives a riddim section that is superb and burning spear is the master of ceremony with his perfect timing and passion. the sound is as clear and pure as any live album you ever heard. \nThe pulsating sounds will energize you and make you want to start chucking! If not then you don't have a pulse.&quot;\n\n&quot;I first owned this on casette in 1990. It was the first reggae I ever owned, and it jams! I was first stuck by the crisp and clear production. On the CD it's even better. You can pick out each individual instrument and vocal. Being a guitarist, I was amazed by the inventiveness of the playing. The songs themselves are longer and more complex than any reggae I've heard before or since. You will groove and sing along all day and night. Don't be surprised if you find yourself humming the songs the next day without realizing that you're doing it.&quot;  \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
