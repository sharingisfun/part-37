Starting with the construction site and the physical building of houses, the book slowly builds and links more and more issues together: from gentrification and city politics to gender roles and identity politics, from subcontracting and speculation to union contracts and negotiation, from intensely personal thoughts and interactions to large-scale political and economic forces. What starts as a look at housing questions, broadens into a critique of capitalism as a whole.\n\nABOLISH RESTAURANTS\na worker's critique of the food service industry\n\nA 60-page illustrated guide to the daily misery, stress, boredom, and alienation of restaurant work, as well as the ways in which restaurant workers fight against it. Drawing on a range of anti-capitalist ideas as well as a heaping plate of personal experience, it is part analysis and part call-to-arms.\n\nWORK COMMUNITY POLITICS WAR\n\nA 28-page comic book introduction to the world as we know it\nand class war manifesto.\n\nCAPITALIST SOCIETY\n\nInspired by the old I.W.W. &quot;PYRAMID of CAPITALIST SYSTEM&quot;, this poster is a portrayal of class society as it appears to us today. The whirlwind of market forces encircle and shape society, operating through our activity, yet behind our backs. People at different levels of the modern capitalist pyramid enjoy it or defend it or cope with it or fight it or get drunk to forget about their place in it. This poster was designed in collaboration with wapiti.se.\n\n\nMore info at prole.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d6f33976bf044b4d408d6308c4378822326a88b","amp;dn":"Prole+ebooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d6f33976bf044b4d408d6308c4378822326a88b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,111,51,151,107,240,68,180,212,8,214,48,140,67,120,130,35,38,168,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
