Brandy de la Court (as Michele Girardon)\n\nHatari! is Swahili for &quot;danger&quot;--and also the word for action, adventure and broad comedy in this two-fisted Howard Hawks effort. John Wayne stars as the head of a daring Tanganyka-based group which captures wild animals on behalf of the world's zoos. Hardy Kruger, GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Blain and Red Buttons are members of Wayne's men-only contingent, all of whom are reduced to jello when the curvaceous Elsa Martinelli enters the scene. In tried and true Howard Hawks fashion, Martinelli quickly becomes &quot;one of the guys,&quot; though Wayne apparently can't say two words to her without sparking an argument. The second half of this amazingly long (159 minute) film concerns the care and maintenance of a baby elephant; the barely credible finale is devoted to a comic pachyderm stampede down an urban African street, ending literally at the foot of Martinelli's bed. The other scene worth mentioning involves comedy-relief Red Buttons' efforts to create a fireworks-powered animal trap. Not to be taken seriously for a minute, Hatari is attractively packaged and neatly tied up with a danceable-pranceable theme song by Henry Mancini. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nRip Specs\n\nDvd-rip XviD\nVideo Bitrate : 1.290 Kbps\nVideo Codec: MPEG-4 AVC\nAudio Codec : AC3\nAudio Bitrate : 256 kbps CBR 48 KHz\nFrame Width (pixels) : 704\nFrame Height (pixels) : 400\nAspect Ratio :  1.760\nFPS : 25.000 FPS\nFile Size : 1.364 GiB\nWidescreen (16x9)\nSubtitle:Cro,Cze,Dan,Eng,Fin,Hun,Isl,Ned,Nor,Pol,Por,Rom,Slo,Srb,Swe and Tur.\n\nnot my rip\n\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
