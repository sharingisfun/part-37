For instance for John Paul Young ( Love is in The Air).\nIn late 1970`s they formed their new band &quot;Flash and the Pan&quot;. This compilation contains material from their first 5 albums as well as a rare non album single.\nHow can you describe their music; it certainly grows on you. You have give it more than one listen ; if it doesn`t hit you the first time.\nTheir weird sounding vocals may disturb some people from the fact that most of their songs are really great. The voices sound like they were recorded through poor radio-microphones; or even a megaphone.\nThe music style varies from disco to rock`n roll ( and everything in between ). Their lyrics are usually both clever and thought-provoking; and often humorous.\nThey had a few minor hit singles which are all included here.\n&quot;Hey St Peter&quot;- &quot;Yesterday`s Gone&quot; &quot;Money Don`t Lie&quot; - Show them at their rocking best\n&quot;Waiting for a Train&quot; - &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot; - are both based quiet disco riffs\nThe single &quot;Something About You Baby Blue&quot; is a very catchy music-hallish song that almost sound like it could have been written by Ray Davies of the Kinks. Great song.&quot;Media Man&quot; and &quot;Midnight Man&quot; are great disco-rockers.\n&quot;Hey Jimmy&quot; great guitar break! quiet disco\n&quot;Down Among The Dead Men&quot; another great tune and another theme F.&amp; P. theme : old legends (Titanic)\n&quot;Early Morning Wake Up Call&quot; ; in my opinion one of their weakest singles - Especially in the elecric drums are very irritating.\n&quot;Ayla&quot; a disco anthem!!\nThis album is highly recommended. Start here and buy all their originals later. There are much more to go for than what can be put on to just one CD.
