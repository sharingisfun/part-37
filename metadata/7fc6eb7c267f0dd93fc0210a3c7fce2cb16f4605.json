The goal is still world domination, battle resolutions are based on the luck of dice, and the theme remains vaguely Napoleonic. However, there are significant and interesting differences. Most important is the use of simultaneous planning and execution of attacks. Players write down their plans, and once revealed, battles are resolved in a prescribed fashion. Also of note is the addition of several territories and connection points, changing the values of continents and making them more difficult to hold; yes, gone are the days of establishing an easy bastion in Australia. The dice rules are significantly different, using 12-sided dice of various strength. And still, there are other alterations that change the nature of the game, yet it retains the flavor of Risk. Simply put, you are still playing Risk, but you no longer have to wait an hour between turns before you can play again; now it is always your turn.\n\n\nInstructions\n\n1)Mount iso or burn\n2)Install game\n3)Play\n\nTo play online, visit www.e-warzone.com and download the wz server (takes seconds)\n\nIt's FREE download, no ad's, no risk, pun intended!
