Many operators prefer the Jeppesen layout for its high-visibility graphics, and the intuitive layout. Some classroom time is required, however, to learn the different format. This is a useful CD presentation of the Jeppesen system, with the convenience of the CD format, but it lacks the DVD convenience of interactive detail, interactive review, and menu selection. It\\&amp;#039;s main objective is to explain the format and notation of the various types of Jeppesen charts. The CD content includes Approach &amp; Airport charts, SIDs &amp; STARs, DPs, and Enroute charts. The CD offers a complete chart training package for operators using the Jeppesen chart system. \nThe Approach/Aiport Chart section includes:\nIntroduction \nHeading \nPlan View \nProfile View \nLanding Minimums \nRNAV \nStrip Charts \nClassic Charts \nThe Enroute Chart section includes:\nIntroduction \nAirspace Depictions \nAirport Symbols \nSymbols for Navigation Aids \nMileage and Changeover Points \nReporting Points \nDefining Airways and Intersections \nEnroute Altitudes \nHigh Altitude Charts \nJet Routes \nMinimum Off-Route Altitudes \nThe SIDs/DPs, and STARs section includes:\nIntroduction \nDeparture Clearances \nObstacle Clearances \nPilot Navigation Departure Procedures \nVector Departure Procedures \nText vs. Graphic Departure \nTakeoff Minimums \nFlying the Transition \nThe Jeppesen Chart Training CD is similar to the now discontinued FlighTime Chart VHS video series, but produced on a single CD video. It is designed to be viewed using a conventional CD player and a television set. However, it may also be viewed using a PC with a CD-ROM drive. Total running time is approximately 2:20. Jeppesen also offers a DVD version of this same material with interactive review questions at the end of each section. \n\nREQ: Norman Manley International Airport (KIN) FS2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d48bb099eb155a607044ae312a120eb64f08ff6","amp;dn":"FS2004+Jeppesen+Chart+Training+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d48bb099eb155a607044ae312a120eb64f08ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,72,187,9,158,177,85,166,7,4,74,227,18,161,32,235,100,240,143,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
