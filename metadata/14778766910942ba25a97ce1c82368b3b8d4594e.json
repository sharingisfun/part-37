Twelve of the deadliest beasts ever forged in the fires of hell have escaped onto our plane, and they want nothing more than to rip out the jugular of Charley Davidson and serve her lifeless, mangled body to Satan for dinner. So there's that. But Charley has more on her plate than a mob of testy hellhounds. For one thing, her father has disappeared, and the more she retraces his last steps, the more she learns he was conducting an investigation of his own, one that has Charley questioning everything she's ever known about him. Add to that an ex-BFF who is haunting her night and day, a rash of suicides that has authorities baffled, and a drop-dead sexy fiancÃƒÂ© who has attracted the attentions of a local celebrity, and Charley is not having the best week of her life.\n\nBut all of that combined barely scratches the surface of her problems. Recent developments - and a few distressing prophesies - have forced her to become a responsible adult. Exactly the kind of adult she's never aspired to be. To conquer such a monumental task, she's decided to start small. Really small. She gets a pet. But how can she save the world against the forces of evil when she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even keep a goldfish alive? A tad north of hell, a hop, skip, and a jump past the realm of eternity, is a little place called Earth, and Charley Davidson, grim reaper extraordinaire, is determined to do everything in her power to protect it. We're doomed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14778766910942ba25a97ce1c82368b3b8d4594e","amp;dn":"Darynda+Jones+-+Seventh+Grave+and+No+Body+-+Charley+Davidson+7+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14778766910942ba25a97ce1c82368b3b8d4594e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,119,135,102,145,9,66,186,37,169,124,225,200,35,104,179,184,212,89,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
