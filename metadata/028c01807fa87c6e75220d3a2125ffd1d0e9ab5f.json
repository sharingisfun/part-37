The duo consists of musicians Nick Littlemore (vocals, production) and Peter Mayes (guitar, production). The pair have achieved multiple successes throughout their career with their award-winning debut album Sambanova, their universally acclaimed 2008 release Pnau, their breakthrough side-project Empire of the Sun, and their multiple chart-topping singles. Pnau is also recognized for their heavily publicized apprenticeship under musician Elton John, who signed the duo after listening to their record Pnau. A number of projects featuring Elton\\'s involvement with the band are currently in development, such as Pnau\\'s new album Soft Universe and an album featuring Pnau recreations of Elton John\\'s hits.\n[...]\nIn an interview with The Music Network, Nick stated that Pnau\\'s next album, entitled Soft Universe, is coming out very soon and described it as a very \\&quot;emotional\\&quot; album, after the recent break up with his girlfriend. Littlemore sings all the vocals on the album and has co-written tracks with Elton John, fellow Aussie artist Martin Craft and producer Mark Saunders. A preview of the first single \\&quot;The Truth\\&quot; was posted online on December 15.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:028c01807fa87c6e75220d3a2125ffd1d0e9ab5f","amp;dn":"PNAU+-+Soft+Universe+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"028c01807fa87c6e75220d3a2125ffd1d0e9ab5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,140,1,128,127,168,124,110,117,34,13,58,33,37,255,209,208,233,171,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
