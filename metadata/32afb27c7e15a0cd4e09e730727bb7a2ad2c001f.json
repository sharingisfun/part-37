Why have these two states pursued mutually conflicting aims in almost every major regional or international foreign policy issue? Why, over the course of the past thirty years, have they often propagated contrasting ideological banners while both acting as though some form of an alignment existed between them? Here Sonoko Sunayama explores the apparent paradox behind this longstanding relationship and argues that what ultimately makes Saudis and Syrians so indispensable to each other is the perception and the historical appeal of 'shared identities', be they Arabism or Islam. \n\nAbout the Author\nSonoko Sunayama obtained her PhD from the London School of Economics, University of London. She has worked as a consultant and researcher on the Arab region and her current position is with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Yemen Country Office.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Syria-Saudi-Arabia-Collaboration-International/dp/1845113020/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373344835&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Syria+and+Saudi+Arabia%3A+Collaboration+and+Conflicts+in+the+Oil+Era&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Syria-Saudi-Arabia-Collaboration-International/dp/1845113020/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373344835&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Syria+and+Saudi+Arabia%3A+Collaboration+and+Conflicts+in+the+Oil+Era&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32afb27c7e15a0cd4e09e730727bb7a2ad2c001f","amp;dn":"Syria+and+Saudi+Arabia%3A+Collaboration+and+Conflicts+in+the+Oil+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32afb27c7e15a0cd4e09e730727bb7a2ad2c001f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,175,178,124,126,21,160,205,78,9,231,48,114,123,183,162,173,44,0,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
