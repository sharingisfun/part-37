After his girlfriend turned down his marriage proposal, Walden was thrown back into the dating world in a serious way. He got invited to a threesome with Alan and his girlfriend, Lindsey, and then created a false identity in order to find a girl who wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t after his money. When WaldenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old friend Missy came to visit, Jake fell so head-over-heels for her he went AWOL from the Army. The guys may have thought things were going to slow down once Jake got transferred to Japan, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to be proven wrong when a niece of AlanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, who shares more than a few characteristics with her father, shows up at the beach house.\n\nÃ‚Â \n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4206566/?ref_=tt_eps_cu_n&quot;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt;\nRatings: 7.3/10 from 23 users   \n\nÃ‚Â \n&lt;blockquote&gt;Encoding Information\nGeneral           : Two.and.a.Half.Men.S12E04.720p.HDTV.QAAC.x264-xRed\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 1 502 Kbps\nLength            : 231 MiB for 21mn 33s 120ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 337 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 157 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f2b8f2c91e991d567516c8760a219d9279cf75","amp;dn":"Two+and+a+Half+Men+S12E04+720p+HDTV+QAAC+x264-xRed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83f2b8f2c91e991d567516c8760a219d9279cf75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,242,184,242,201,30,153,29,86,117,22,200,118,10,33,157,146,121,207,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
