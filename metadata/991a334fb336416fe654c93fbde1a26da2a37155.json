He's not commonly credited for his role in helping popularize the bossa nova in the '60s, but Bailey learned the rhythm while touring South America in 1959 and helped many American drummers master the sound. A solid swing and bop player, Bailey's credits include stints with Johnny Hodges, Charles Mingus, Lou Donaldson, Curtis Fuller and Horace Silver. But most jazz fans remember his contributions to various Gerry Mulligan groups from 1954-1968, and his work with Clark Terry and Bob Brookmeyer in the '60s. Bailey returned to duty as a pilot and flight instructor in 1969, temporarily ending his music involvement. He became active in education and administration in 1973, and has been executive director of The Jazzmobile in New York City.\n\n[b]AMG Review of &quot;Gettin' Into Somethin&quot; by Ken Dryden[/b]\nThis LP was the second of three dates led by drummer Dave Bailey for Epic in the early '60s, all of which were recorded live in the studio with an invited audience. His supporting cast is a potent one, with trumpeter and flugelhornist Clark Terry, tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse, trombonist Curtis Fuller, pianist Horace Parlan, and bassist Peck Morrison. This blowing session starts off with a foot-patting blues by Terry, the amusingly titled &quot;Slop Jah.&quot; Terry co-wrote &quot;Little Old Mongoose&quot; with Archie Moore (the light heavyweight boxing champion who was also a musician and jazz fan); this up-tempo swinger features Terry's excellent muted solo and a carousing effort by Rouse, too. Terry also composed the brisk &quot;Evad Smurd&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Dave Drums&quot;), which seems to be a well-disguised reworking of &quot;Oh, Lady Be Good&quot;; Bailey actually takes a series of drum breaks, which is rare for him since he prefers time keeping to the solo spotlight. An extended workout of Horace Parlan's &quot;Blues for J.P.&quot; has great solos all around, as well as Terry at first on flugelhorn and later on trumpet. This first-rate record isn't available on CD, though it seems like a logical reissue candidate, but in any case it is well-worth acquiring.\n\n[b]AMG Review of &quot;One Foot In The Gutter&quot; by Ken Dryden[/b]\nDave Bailey's One Foot in the Gutter is the first of several dates which originally appeared on Epic in the early 1960s but has been hard to find until this CD reissue came out. The veteran drummer literally leads a blowing session in the studio without any prepared arrangements or set list, inspired by an invited audience of friends and jazz fans. The musicians include the outstanding front line of Clark Terry, Junior Cook and Curtis Fuller, along with Horace Parlan and Peck Morrison joining the leader in the rhythm section. The music is consistently loose, fresh and very inspired; egos have been checked at the door as everyone aspires to work together to produce the best results. Clark Terry's sauntering bluesy &quot;One Foot in the Gutter&quot; gets things off on the right foot, followed by a burning interpretation of Thelonious Monk's &quot;Well You Needn't,&quot; featuring Terry's almost conversational fluegelhorn, as well as an intense, well-paced tenor sax solo by Cook and an inventive turn in the spotlight by Parlan. The finale is an extended workout of Clifford Brown's &quot;Sandu&quot; which pushes everyone to a peak. The results were so successful that additional sessions (Gettin' Into Something and Two Feet in the Gutter soon followed; this release is strong proof that talented musicians don't have to meticulously plan out their set to produce timeless music.\n\n[b]AMG Review of &quot;Two Feet In The Gutter&quot; by Ken Dryden[/b]\nDrummer Dave Bailey's third and final LP for Epic is a quintet session that is much like his earlier two sextet dates for the label, with an invited audience witnessing the studio recording. He has a completely new supporting cast, including two very underappreciated musicians: the tragically short-lived tenor saxophonist Frank Haynes and trumpeter Bill Hardman. Also on hand are the veteran bassist Ben Tucker and the somewhat-obscure pianist Billy Gardner. Tucker's &quot;Comin' Home Baby&quot; is probably better known for the vocal version with lyrics by singer Bob Dorough, but evidently the music came first, as this instrumental version swings hard and doesn't have the rock flavor that Dorough's (and other later vocal) versions have. Haynes' big-toned tenor sax and Hardman's muted trumpet are the highlights of the relaxed but brisk swinger &quot;Two Feet in the Gutter.&quot; Frank Foster's &quot;Shiny Stockings,&quot; written for Count Basie and a jazz standard, has an economical swinging piano solo by young pianist Gardner that is at times economical ÃƒÂ  la Basie and at other times has the block-chord feeling of Red Garland. Tucker also contributed &quot;Coffee Walk,&quot; a tasty mid-tempo blues. While this record is just a notch beneath Dave Bailey's earlier dates for Epic -- One Foot in the Gutter and Gettin' into Somethin' -- it is definitely worth picking up.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:991a334fb336416fe654c93fbde1a26da2a37155","amp;dn":"Dave+Bailey+-+The+Complete+Feet+In+The+Gutter+Sessions+%281960-61%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"991a334fb336416fe654c93fbde1a26da2a37155","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,26,51,79,179,54,65,111,230,84,201,63,189,225,162,109,162,163,113,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
