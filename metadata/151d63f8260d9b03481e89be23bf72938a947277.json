One year ago the magazine was not known and the magazine faced many hardships. The staff members were limited and finding innovative people to contribute to the magazine was like witnessing a solar eclipse. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fast forward into 2013 and be thankful for the growth the magazine has been able to transpire to. People are now proud to read GHM and they also want to work for the company.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:151d63f8260d9b03481e89be23bf72938a947277","amp;dn":"Glass+Hat+Magazine+-+Issue+14+-+P2P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"151d63f8260d9b03481e89be23bf72938a947277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,29,99,248,38,13,155,3,72,30,137,190,35,191,114,147,138,148,114,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
