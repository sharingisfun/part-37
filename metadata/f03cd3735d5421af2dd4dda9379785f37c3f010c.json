Perhaps what this raspy-voiced Canadian troubadour has perfected is best described as North Country music. Owing something to Steve Earle's feistiness, John Prine's working-class song craft, and, as he develops in the studio, Tom Waits's musical dissonance, Eaglesmith creates music that's ultimately reflective of his background. One of nine kids, he grew up on a farm in southern Ontario, left home at 15 when his parents lost their spread, and has been making music ever since. \n\n&quot;Drive-In Movie&quot; is the folk/alternative country album from Canadian-songwriter Fred Eaglesmith. This effort earned Eaglesmith Canada's prestigious Juno Award--the Canadian equivalent of a Grammy Award--in 1996 for &quot;Best Roots &amp; Traditional Solo Album.&quot; The songs on this, his seventh, album reveal Eaglesmith at his edgy best, with stories that leave you with a wry smile of recognition, nostalgia or dark humor. \n\n01.
