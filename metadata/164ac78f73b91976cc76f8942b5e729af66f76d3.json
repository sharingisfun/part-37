Otherwise, you will hear static.\n\nNotes and disclaimers:\nIt is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\nIf you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.\n\nLatest from a band I actually feel is quite underrated. This underwhelmed me during the first few listens but has really grown on me since. Separates a lot better than their other albums through SPEC as well, which was a nice surprise.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n'Lost In The Echo'\n'In My Remains'\n'Burn It Down'\n'Lies Greed Misery'\n'I'll Be Gone'\n'Castle Of Glass'\n'Victimized'\n'Roads Untraveled'\n'Skin To Bone'\n'Until It Breaks'\n'Tinfoil'\n'Powerless'\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDKA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:164ac78f73b91976cc76f8942b5e729af66f76d3","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Living+Things+%28SPEC+DTS+5.1+CD+by+DKA%29+%28SBU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"164ac78f73b91976cc76f8942b5e729af66f76d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,74,199,143,115,185,25,118,204,118,248,148,43,94,114,154,246,111,118,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
