Writers Batmanglij and Marling spent two months in 2009 practicing freeganism and co-wrote a screenplay inspired by their experiences and drawing on thrillers from the 1970s. The American studio Fox Searchlight Pictures had bought rights to distribute Batmanglij's previous film Sound of My Voice and also collaborated with the director to produce The East. With Ridley Scott as producer and Tony Scott as executive producer, Fox Searchlight contracted Scott Free Productions, headquartered in London, to produce the film. The East was filmed in two months in Shreveport, Louisiana at the end of 2011. The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2013. It was released in theaters on May 31, 2013.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1ea1850572ce2b82c2154066369841ffa10c48c","amp;dn":"The+East+%282013%29+DVD5+PAL+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1ea1850572ce2b82c2154066369841ffa10c48c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,234,24,80,87,44,226,184,44,33,84,6,99,105,132,31,250,16,196,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
