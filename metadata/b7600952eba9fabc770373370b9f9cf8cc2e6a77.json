Ford had originally assembled this lineup to record his 1979 solo album The Inside Story which was released under the name of Robben Ford. During this initial period the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound combined elements of blues, jazz fusion, and progressive rock with Ford contributing vocals. Over the next year the group began moving in a more democratic direction, eliminating FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals and embracing a more commercially oriented jazz-funk approach overall and the band signed with Warner Bros. as Yellowjackets.\n\nAs they continue to evolve, the Yellowjackets have gradually gone from being an R&amp;B-oriented fusion band to a more acoustic group that emphasizes fairly straight-ahead improvisations. Although this CD has nine originals by bandmembers and some electronics are utilized (primarily by keyboardist Russell Ferrante for color), much of the music would satisfy even hard bop listeners. Bob Mintzer's many solos on tenor, soprano, bass clarinet and EWI are excellent, but it is the tightness of the rhythm section (which also includes bassist Jimmy Haslip and drummer William Kennedy) that continues to give the Yellowjackets their own original sound","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7600952eba9fabc770373370b9f9cf8cc2e6a77","amp;dn":"Yellowjackets+-+Blue+Hats+%281997%29+EAC-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7600952eba9fabc770373370b9f9cf8cc2e6a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,96,9,82,235,169,250,188,119,3,115,55,11,159,156,248,204,46,106,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
