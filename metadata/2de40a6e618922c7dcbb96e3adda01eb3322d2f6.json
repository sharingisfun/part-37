A.D. 300 in all major mediaÃ¢â‚¬â€terracottas, bronzes, gems, glass, silver and gold plate, and jewelry. The distinction of the collection, however, lies in the stone sculptures that are unequalled in any other institution and that are beautifully illustrated and cataloged in this unique publication. The 635 large-scale stone sarcophagi, funerary monuments, and votive sculptures, primarily of the sixth through fourth centuries B.C., testify to the wealth and power of the individuals that commissioned them. The exceptional variety of types reflects the succession of rulers that dominated the island and exploited its resources, and shows influences of the cultural exchanges with other great early civilizations across the Mediterranean.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2de40a6e618922c7dcbb96e3adda01eb3322d2f6","amp;dn":"The+Cesnola+Collection+of+Cypriot+-+Stone+Sculpture+%28Art+Ebook%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2de40a6e618922c7dcbb96e3adda01eb3322d2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,228,10,110,97,137,34,199,220,187,150,227,173,218,1,235,51,34,210,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
