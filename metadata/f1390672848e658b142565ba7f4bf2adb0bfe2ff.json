We all hope that these aspects of our life will be a source of fulfillment and pleasure, and they often are. Yet they are also always sources of problems for which we seek practical advice and solutions. The best prescription, according to ChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶gyam Trungpa, is a dose of reality and also a dose of respect for ourselves and our world. His profound teachings on work, sex, and money celebrate the sacredness of life and our ability to cope with its twists and turns with dignity, humor, and even joy. He begins by breaking down the barrier between the spiritual and the mundane, showing that work, sex, and money are just as much a part of our spiritual life as they are a part of our everyday existence. He then discusses these subjects in relation to ego and self-image, karma, mindfulness, and meditation. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ includes general principles of mindfulness and awareness in how we conduct everyday life as well as discussion of ethics in business and the workplace. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSexÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is about relationships and communication as a whole. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMoneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ looks at how we view the economics of livelihood and money as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgreen energyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that affects our lives. The result is an inclusive vision of life, one that encompasses the biggest issues and the smallest details of every day. There are, in fact, few definitive answers in these pages. There is, however, authentic wisdom providing us with tools we need to work with the toughest stuff in our lives.\n\nContents\n\nEditor's Preface vii\n\n1. The Sacred Society\n2.
