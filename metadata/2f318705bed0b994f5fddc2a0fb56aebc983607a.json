Recording information: Bearsville, Studios, Bearsville, NY; Uncle Punchy, Silverspring, MD. One of the most diverse and unpredictable heavy-rock acts of the 1990s and 2000s, Clutch quickly garnered a loyal following with a sound that flat-out rocked yet refused to be pigeonholed. ROBOT HIVE/EXODUS is no exception. &quot;The Incomparable Mr. Flannery&quot; kicks off the record with a swaggering Zeppelin-meets-Ted Nugent bit of unadulterated stud rock and never lets up. It would be tempting to call this stoner rock, except for the fact that it's so high-energy. In addition, Neil Fallon's macho vocals belie his insightful, often strikingly poetic lyrics. &quot;Mice and Gods&quot; name-checks both Lucifer and OMNI Magazine, while &quot;Pulaski Skyway&quot; paints a vivid portrait of industrial greed. A meaty-sounding dose of gritty guitar rock that wears its 1970s influences on its sleeve, ROBOT HIVE/EXODUS aims to hit the gut and enlighten the mind \n \n \n Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic, \n HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality \n of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is! \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.The incomparable mr.
