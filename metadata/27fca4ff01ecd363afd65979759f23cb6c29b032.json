Remember to seed :)\n\n&quot;The story takes place in the same official Code Geass history as the anime, but in a different era.

The story begins when Renya encounters a mysterious, perpetually young witch named &quot;ReifÃ…Â« C.C.&quot; C.C. has appeared in Japan's historical Edo era to seek a new partner for a covenant. Meanwhile, a mysterious man, with a striking resemblance to the character Lelouch of the original anime, also appears with unknown intentions.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27fca4ff01ecd363afd65979759f23cb6c29b032","amp;dn":"Code+Geass%3A+Shikkoku+no+Renya+ch1-11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27fca4ff01ecd363afd65979759f23cb6c29b032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,252,164,255,1,236,211,99,175,214,89,121,117,159,35,203,108,41,176,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
