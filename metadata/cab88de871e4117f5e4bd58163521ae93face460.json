The film features Robert Bixby, director of the Concord Coalition, and David Walker, the former U.S. Comptroller-General, as they travel around the United States on a tour to let communities know of the potential dangers of the national debt. This is a tour carried out through the Concord Coalition, and is known as the &quot;Fiscal Wake-Up Tour.&quot; In February 2008, Walker announced that he would be resigning from his post as Comptroller General to become the president and CEO of the newly established Peter G. Peterson Foundation. His term is scheduled to end in 2013. He states that he feels he can more freely draw attention to the serious issues the U.S. is facing from this position.[2]\n\nThe film began its nationwide showing at the Holland Performing Arts Center in Omaha, Nebraska on 21 August 2008, with a live discussion among Warren Buffett, Pete Peterson, David Walker, William Niskanen, and Bill Novelli following the screening.\n\nThe companion book, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, was released in September 2008. Written by the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s executive producer Addison Wiggin and Agora Financial's Managing Editor, Kate Incontrera, the book expands on the film and details AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s budget, personal savings, trade, and leadership deficits. It also elaborates on several statistics mentioned in the movie - from the $9 trillion federal debt to the $738.6 billion trade deficit to the fact that each citizen owes an average of $30,000. The book includes interviews with Warren Buffett, Alan Greenspan, Paul Volcker, Robert Rubin, Alice Rivlin, Pete Peterson, David Walker, Paul OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Neill, James Areddy, Arthur Laffer, Steve Forbes, and Bill Bonner.[3]\n\nI.O.U.S.A. made the Roger Ebert's list of five best documentary films of 2008.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cab88de871e4117f5e4bd58163521ae93face460","amp;dn":"I.O.U.S.A+%28FULL+VERSION%29+%2A2008%2A+%5BWEBRip.DivX-NoGrp%5D+%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cab88de871e4117f5e4bd58163521ae93face460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,184,141,232,113,228,17,127,94,75,213,129,99,82,26,233,63,172,228,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
