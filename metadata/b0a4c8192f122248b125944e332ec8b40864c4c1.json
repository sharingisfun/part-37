Fragments of bone or fabric placed inside a bejewelled shrine, a sculpted golden head or even a life-sized silver hand were, and still are, objects of religious devotion believed to have the power to work miracles. Most precious of all, though, are relics of Jesus Christ and the programme also features three reliquaries containing the holiest of all relics - those associated with the Crucifixion. The story of relics and reliquaries is a 2,000-year history of faith, persecution and hope, reflected in some of the most beautiful and little known works of art ever made. Featuring interviews with art historian Sister Wendy Beckett and Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012248j&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012248j&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 5000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1440x810\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 2.20 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid and SRT available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0a4c8192f122248b125944e332ec8b40864c4c1","amp;dn":"BBC+Treasures+of+Heaven+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0a4c8192f122248b125944e332ec8b40864c4c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,164,200,25,47,18,34,72,177,37,148,78,51,46,200,180,8,100,196,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
