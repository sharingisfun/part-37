It focuses on stock markets and exchanges, associated trading, clearing, and settlement, and on payment systems, set in their historical and current contexts. The new edition includes updated content in light of all of the recent changes announced to the UK system of financial regulation, and has been expanded to provide a wider international reach including coverage of relevant EU, US and Asian markets. The book examines financial derivatives and the regulation of other specific markets including equity and debt, both on-exchange and off-exchange from UK, European and International perspectives. It also includes associated topics, such as global custody and credit rating.\n\nSince the first edition published in 2007 and following the financial crisis, there have been major changes made, or proposed, to financial regulatory regimes at national, regional and international levels. In the UK and the EU generally the implementation of MiFID has had a significant impact on the shape and structure of the markets. Those changes have been reflected in the work. Institutional revision within the EU, including the creation of five new agencies in the banking and financial areas, and the allied developments on payments and electronic money are covered. \n\nThe book examines regional developments alongside domestic measures including the changes to the FSA Handbook (particularly on Listing, Prospectuses and Disclosure), the proposals under the Financial Services Bill, and parallel revisions under the Dodd Frank Act in the US. The publication of this second edition is particularly timely due to new emphasis on the systematically important elements of market infrastructure in European regulation, and the general shift of policy making initiatives from the member states to the central institutions of the EU.\nReadership: Banking and investment business legal practitioners and compliance officers as well as lawyers working in finance ministries and international financial institutions, and scholars.\n\n\nAUTHOR INFO\n\nEdited by Michael Blair QC, 3 Verulam Buildings, Gray's Inn, London, George Walker, School of Law, Queen Mary, University of London, and Stuart Willey, White &amp; Case LLP\n\nMichael Blair QC is in independent practice at the Bar of England and Wales specialising in financial services.
