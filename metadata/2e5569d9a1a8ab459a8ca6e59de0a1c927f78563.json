During the commentary of ARmy of Darkness, Bruce Campbell states he is suprised that no film school student hasn't edited the movies together. I'm no film student. (you'll see if you downloaded) I used virtual dub to cut off the ending of Evil Dead 1 right as it goes to black in Ash's mouth. I cut off begining of Evil Dead 2 where we go to Ash's mouth. I edited them together at that point. At the end of Evil Dead two after Ash goes into the vortex it blinks the whole screen black and white. I cut it off there. In Army of darkness after Ash tells how he got to 13th century there is the same flashing of light and explosion. I grafted Army of Darkness there. The only other things I did was changing the first 13 seconds to change the title and to edit out tthe bridge scene in Evil Dead 2. Ash already tried the bridge in Evil Dead 1. I just took out the scene in Evil Dead 2. Basically he stops sees something in the road off camera and puts it in reverse. The copy of Evil Dead 1 I used isn't that great, but it's passable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e5569d9a1a8ab459a8ca6e59de0a1c927f78563","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Dead+-+The+Evil+Dead+Trilogy+as+one+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e5569d9a1a8ab459a8ca6e59de0a1c927f78563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,85,105,217,161,168,171,69,154,140,166,229,157,224,161,201,39,247,133,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
