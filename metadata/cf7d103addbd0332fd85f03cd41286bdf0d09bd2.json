Not content with starting life as a full blown, planned event it took a young man called William Webb Ellis to decide in 1823 that instead of kicking the football he would pick it up and run with it.\n\nFrom that day at Rugby School a new sport took its place in our heritage. A sport that would be unjoyed by more than 100 nations across the globe.\n\nSince 1823 Rugby Union has enjoyed revolution after revolution, from its break from Rugby League to its move to professionalism and the advent of the Six Nations Championship.\n\nThe game has produced some of sport's most famous players from Gareth Edwards and Barry John to Bill Beaumont, Will Carling and the current superstar, Jonny Wilkinson. It has also produced two of the most famous international teams, The British and Irish Lions, particularly the teams of 1971 and 1974, and the world renowned Barbarians who ran from their own try line in 1973 to score the most famous try the game has ever seen.\n\n130 min\n\nVideo; x264; 704*572 (4:3); 1787 kbps; 25.000 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz\n\n5023093000097","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf7d103addbd0332fd85f03cd41286bdf0d09bd2","amp;dn":"Century+of+Rugby+Presented+by+Rob+Andrew+2003+DVDRip+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf7d103addbd0332fd85f03cd41286bdf0d09bd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,125,16,58,221,189,3,50,253,133,240,60,212,18,134,189,240,208,155,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
