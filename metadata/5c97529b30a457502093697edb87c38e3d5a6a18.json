He is the first in what will become a long line of peculiar physicians. Plagued by madness and guided by an intense desire to cure human affliction, each generation of this unusual family is driven by the science of its day: spontaneous combustion, phrenology, animal magnetism, electrical shock treatment, psychosurgery, genetic research. As they make their way in the world, New York City, too, evolvesÃ¢â‚¬â€from the dark and rough days of the seventeenth century to the towering, frenetic metropolis of today.\n\nLike Patrick SÃƒÂ¼skind's classic novel Perfume, Kirsten Menger-Anderson's debut is a literary cabinet of curiositiesÃ¢â‚¬â€fascinating and unsettling, rich and utterly singular.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c97529b30a457502093697edb87c38e3d5a6a18","amp;dn":"Doctor+Olaf+van+Schuler%27s+Brain+by+Kirsten+Menger-Anderson+%28reta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c97529b30a457502093697edb87c38e3d5a6a18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,151,82,155,48,164,87,80,32,147,105,126,219,135,195,142,61,90,106,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
