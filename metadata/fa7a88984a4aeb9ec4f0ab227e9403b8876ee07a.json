Fans of Thrillbent, Monkeybrain, or DC Digital First style comics should definitely check it out. \n\nWe would like to bring TEMPLATE to print, and need your help. From now until September 13 we are running a Kickstarter campaign to fund a 1000 copy print run to bring the first story arc to retail stores nationwide. The link to the project page is here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qmiles/template-volume-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qmiles/template-volume-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSo score some cool stuff and help us get TEMPLATE into the hands of more people as well. If this works, we can potentially even start work on a Volume 2, so spread the word if you like what we're doing!\n\nThanks!\n\nQ\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7a88984a4aeb9ec4f0ab227e9403b8876ee07a","amp;dn":"TEMPLATE+-+August+28%2C+2013+%28Week+20%29+PDF+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7a88984a4aeb9ec4f0ab227e9403b8876ee07a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,122,136,152,74,74,235,158,196,240,171,34,126,148,3,184,135,110,224,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
