This process is called &quot;Rememory&quot; and Alan H. Hakman (Robin Williams), a man traumatized by an incident in his childhood, is the best cutter of the Eye Tech Corporation. The company is facing groups that oppose to the &quot;Rememory&quot; and the ex-cutter Fletcher (Jim Caviezel) is leading these opponents. When Alan is assigned to prepare the final cut of the memories of the Eye Tech lawyer Charles Bannister, his Zoe chip is wanted by Fletcher because it has memories that Fletcher wants to bring eye tech down and nothing will stand in his wy to obtain it.\n\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFCCP.jpg[/IMG]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364343/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364343/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat :      AVI\nFormat/Info :     Audio Video Interleave\nFile size :     1.09 GiB\nDuration :     1h 34mn\nOverall bit rate :     1 657 Kbps\nWriting application :     VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library :     VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nFormat :     MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile :     Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP :     No\nFormat settings, QPel :     No\nFormat settings, GMC :     No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix :     Custom\nCodec ID :     XVID\nCodec ID/Hint :     XviD\nDuration :     1h 34mn\nBit rate :     1 203 Kbps\nWidth :     720 pixels\nHeight :     304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio :     2.35\nFrame rate :     23.976 fps\nResolution :     24 bits\nColorimetry :     4:2:0\nScan type :     Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) :     0.229\nStream size :     813 MiB (73%)\nWriting library :     XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nFormat :     AC-3\nFormat/Info :     Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID :     2000\nDuration :     1h 34mn\nBit rate mode :     Constant\nBit rate :     448 Kbps\nChannel(s) :     6 channels\nChannel positions :     Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate :     48.0 KHz\nStream size :     303 MiB (27%)\nAlignment :     Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration :     96 ms (2.30 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration :     96 ms\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : THE FINAL CUT.DEWSTRRT F C CP.sfv\nFile size :     1.63 KiB\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : THE FINAL\nFile size :     47.0 Bytes\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC4.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC5.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC6.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC8.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC9.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/476352oop/MOVIES/TFC10.jpg[/IMG]\nburned with windows [with a couple of other movies on a disk] and played on my philips divx ultra certified dvd player\nbe sure to set your dvd player on the correct aspect ratio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57f0cff52e1b4751a29f896e4317a1994081b08c","amp;dn":"THE+FINAL+CUT.DEWSTRR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57f0cff52e1b4751a29f896e4317a1994081b08c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,240,207,245,46,27,71,81,162,159,137,110,67,23,161,153,64,129,176,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
