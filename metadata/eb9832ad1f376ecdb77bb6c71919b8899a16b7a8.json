As the blues conquered the world and the music moved from black to white audiences, arguments developed about what was the real authentic blues. Robert Johnson returned from the dead to sell more records than any other blues artist. By the 21st century, the blues not only retained the earthiness of its roots but was also being celebrated in the White House. With contributions from Keith Richards, Bonnie Raitt, Seasick Steve and Buddy Guy.  \r\n\r\n\r\nGSpot Says:\r\nDVD VOB format\r\nMPEG-2Program Stream &lt;&lt; (1 vid, 1 aud)\r\nSys Bitrate 10080 kb/s VBR 8646 kbps I/L TFF\r\nPAL 16:9\r\n\r\nAC3 0xbd[0x80]:48000Hz 384 kb/s tot,\r\nStereo (2/0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay It LOUD!\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb9832ad1f376ecdb77bb6c71919b8899a16b7a8","amp;dn":"Blues+America-Part+2-BrightLightsBigCity-BBCTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb9832ad1f376ecdb77bb6c71919b8899a16b7a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,152,50,173,31,55,110,205,183,123,182,199,25,25,184,137,154,22,183,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
