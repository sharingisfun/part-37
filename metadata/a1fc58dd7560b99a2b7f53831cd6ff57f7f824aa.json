Again, they pad the album with covers, but the Bakersfield bounce of &quot;Act Naturally&quot; adds new flavor (along with an ideal showcase for Ringo's amiable vocals) and &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzie&quot; gives John an opportunity to flex his rock &amp; roll muscle. George is writing again and if his two contributions don't touch Lennon and McCartney's originals, they hold their own against much of their British pop peers. \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Help!
