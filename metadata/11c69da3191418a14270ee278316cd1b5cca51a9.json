The people of Lanagan's worlds face trials, temptations, and degradations. They swoon and suffer and even kill for love. In a dangerous world, they seek the solace and strength that comes from family and belonging. \n\n   These are stories to be savored slowly and pondered deeply because they cut to the very heart of who we are.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c69da3191418a14270ee278316cd1b5cca51a9","amp;dn":"Yellowcake+-+Margo+Lanagan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c69da3191418a14270ee278316cd1b5cca51a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,198,157,163,25,20,24,161,66,112,238,39,131,22,205,27,92,202,81,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
