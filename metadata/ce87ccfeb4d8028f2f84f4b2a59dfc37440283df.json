Probably the best part of this series at least to me, a fan for years. \n    This is a documentary, NOT a musical preformance although you can\\&amp;#039;t do such a thing without including segments of certian preformances etc. I found this to be very good and a well done film that includes interviews with many of the people who knew Jimi best. Musicians and friends alike including segments from Jimi himself. Great stuff.\n                                                                    srw567","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce87ccfeb4d8028f2f84f4b2a59dfc37440283df","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix-Uncut+1967-%5C%2770+Documentary+%28the+best","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce87ccfeb4d8028f2f84f4b2a59dfc37440283df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,135,204,254,180,216,2,143,47,132,244,178,165,157,252,55,68,2,131,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
