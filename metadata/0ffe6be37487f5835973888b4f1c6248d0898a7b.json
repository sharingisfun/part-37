Prior to its cancellation, Van Buren was set to carry on the Fallout series, but was not a sequel to Fallout 2. An official Fallout 3, unrelated to the abandoned Van Buren project, was developed by Bethesda Game Studios after Interplay sold the single-player rights to the franchise to Bethesda Softworks. It was released October 28, 2008.[1]\n\nSeveral Black Isle staff members would go on to form Obsidian Entertainment, and many themes, factions and characters of Van Buren were incorporated in Obsidian's Fallout: New Vegas, published by Bethesda Softworks in 2010, Most notably the NCR VS BOS war, The characters Alice Mclaferty, Caesar and others, and the Legion.\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided as is, i dont give any help on it.\n\nwoop woop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ffe6be37487f5835973888b4f1c6248d0898a7b","amp;dn":"van+buren+Demo+fallout+3+original","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ffe6be37487f5835973888b4f1c6248d0898a7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,254,107,227,116,135,245,131,89,115,136,139,79,28,98,72,208,137,138,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
