Alice Clark has a rich soulful voice, with a style that sounds a bit like Esther Marrow, mixed with some of the lead vocalists in Voices Of East Harlem -a really right-on sort of sound that's totally great, and way hipper than most 70s chart soul! Arrangements are by Ernie Wilkins, who brings in a touch of jazz but again, with a much hipper feel than most of his other backings and most of the tracks are quite obscure, well-written tunes of the sort of material you might expect to hear sung by Gil Scott-Heron or Donny Hathaway.\n\n1 I Keep It Hid (3:27)\n2 Looking At Life (3:10)\n3 Don't Worry Why (3:22)\n4 Maybe This Time (3:18)\n5 Never Did I Stop Loving You (2:34)\n6 Charms Of The Arms Of Love (2:38)\n7 Don't You Care (2:49)\n8 It Takes Too Long To Learn To Live Alone (3:34)\n9 Hard Hard Promises (3:05)\n10 Hey Girl (3:16)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6788b66bd74a7a9ccd35608873f989e52a10bc18","amp;dn":"Alice+Clark+-+Alice+Clark+%5B1972%5D+%5BAlbum%5D+%5B1999+Toshiba+EMI+Ltd+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6788b66bd74a7a9ccd35608873f989e52a10bc18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,136,182,107,215,74,122,156,205,53,96,136,115,249,137,229,42,16,188,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
