Color images of whole, hematoxylin, and eosin stained sagittal, coronal, and horizontal sections are provided at four different ages. In addition, high magnification images are included that highlight areas of developmental interest. The atlas is designed to support research of normal and abnormal brain development in developmental neuroscience, gene manipulation, molecular biology, and neurotoxicology. \n\nKey Features: \n\n* Color images of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections \n* 26 High magnification images, highlighting areas of developmental interest \n* 254 images and matching diagrams with outlined and annotated structures: \n\nGestational Day (GD) 12 heads: \n\n16 GD 12 sagittal \n22 GD 12 coronal \n18 GD 12 horizontal \n\nGD 14 heads: \n\n20 GD 14 sagittal \n33 GD 14 coronal \n24 GD 14 horizontal \n\nGD 16 brains: \n\n16 GD 16 sagittal \n30 GD 16 coronal \n17 GD 16 horizontal \n\nGD 18 brains: \n17 GD 18 sagittal \n26 GD 18 coronal \n15 GD 18 horizontal \n\n* Delineation of peripheral nerves, eyes, inner ear, ganglia and other structures in the heads of GD 12 and 14 embryos \n\nAbout the author: \n\nDr. Uta Schambra is Associate Professor in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology at Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee, USA. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf87441ce9f9ec3738bfb6ec1de23deeb8238584","amp;dn":"Prenatal+Mouse+Brain+Atlas%3A+Color+images+and+annotated+diagrams+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf87441ce9f9ec3738bfb6ec1de23deeb8238584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,135,68,28,233,249,236,55,56,191,182,236,29,226,61,238,184,35,133,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
