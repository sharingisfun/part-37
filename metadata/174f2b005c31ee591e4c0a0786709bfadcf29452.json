Photoreal threshold, etc.\nThis is a work in progress and will be updated/improved with even more photoreal textures and enhancements.\n\nInstallation: Copy all texture files in the package to the texture\ndirectory of your imagine simulationKLGA La Guardia folder. Typically it's in the root directory \nof your FS2004/FS9 directory.\n\nWe'll be looking for anyone who wants to contribute to the project. In particular,\n\n1) Someone who can add car traffic to the outside roads/Grand Central would be win.\n\n2) Someone who can throw in the new control tower\n\n3) Someone who could create a tile in the Flushing Meadows Park area. I could apply\nthe textures\n\n4) Someone who could create the Citifield stadium and or improve the Flushing Meadows Park monuments/buildings.\n\nI'll put out a contact address in the next version for anyone who's interested in helping out.\nMore to come. Enjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:174f2b005c31ee591e4c0a0786709bfadcf29452","amp;dn":"FS2004+KLGA+LaGuardia+Imaginesim+Enhancement+Version+1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"174f2b005c31ee591e4c0a0786709bfadcf29452","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,79,43,0,92,49,238,89,30,76,10,7,134,112,155,250,220,242,148,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
