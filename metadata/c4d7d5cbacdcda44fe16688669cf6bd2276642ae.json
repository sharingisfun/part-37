It follows the plot, does a great job with the casting and manages to find ways to make the narrative come to life.  Ostensibly, this is the story of Major Scobie, a police inspector in WWII Africa who has an affair while his wife is also having an affair and tries to make the best of the situation.  But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just plot.  That doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give you any idea of the depth of the character of Major Scobie or the guilt that ravages his soul, for this is a film (and novel) about Catholicism and all the pain and guilt and burden that come along with it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4d7d5cbacdcda44fe16688669cf6bd2276642ae","amp;dn":"The+Heart+of+the+Matter+%281953%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4d7d5cbacdcda44fe16688669cf6bd2276642ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,215,213,203,172,220,218,68,254,22,104,134,105,207,107,210,39,102,66,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
