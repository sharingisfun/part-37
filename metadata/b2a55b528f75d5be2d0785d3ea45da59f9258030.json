This is yet another project that Bob Mersereau put together a few years ago so I thought hey why not, I'll make a torrent of these songs. After all I already have most of them after putting together the Canadian album torrent. Track 74, &quot;1990&quot; by Jean Leloup I could not find in lossless so I used an mp3. I didn't want to use an mp3 but other than ordering the album which would take weeks to arrive (and one I didn't want) I figured what the heck. Audiochecker Log is included, some tracks are showing as mpeg but rest assured they are false positives as most of these are my own personal rips. Tracks showing mpeg include: Try - Blue Rodeo, Sundown - Gordon Lightfoot, Rockin' In The Free World - Neil Young (Error), and Wondering Where The Lions Are - Bruce Cockburn.\n\n\n So anyhow - here it is. Enjoy.\n\n\nKit \n\n\n\n\n\n[The Top 100 Canadian Singles is a book by Bob Mersereau, published in 2008 by Goose Lane Editions.\n\nMersereau acknowledged that the list will cause heated debate among music fans across the country. &quot;The important part is to talk about Canadian music and enjoy it&quot;, he said. &quot;I'd be shocked if there wasn't complaints and arguments and debates.&quot;\n\nMersereau surveyed 600 music journalists, retailers, musicians and disc jockeys of all ages, from all parts of Canada. They each submitted a list of 10 favourite Canadian singles released between 1958 and 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1. The Guess Who ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;American Woman&quot;\n2.
