One phenomenally entertaining language book.\n\nIn his waggish yet authoritative book, Ben Yagoda has managed to undo the dark work of legions of English teachers and libraries of dusty grammar texts. Not since School House Rock have adjectives, adverbs, articles, conjunctions, interjections, nouns, prepositions, pronouns, and verbs been explored with such infectious exuberance. Read If You Catch an Adjective, Kill It and:\n\nLearn how to write better with classic advice from writers such as Mark Twain (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf you catch an adjective, kill itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), Stephen King (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI believe the road to hell is paved with adverbsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and Gertrude Stein (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNouns . . . are completely not interestingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). \n\nMarvel at how a single word can shift from adverb (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI did okayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), to adjective (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was an okay movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), to interjection (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOkay!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), to noun (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI gave my okayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), to verb (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho okayed this?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), depending on its use. \n\nAvoid the pretentious preposition at, a favorite of real estate developers (e.g., ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Shoppes at White PlainsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). \n\nLaugh when Yagoda says he ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshall call anyone a dork to the end of his daysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ who insists on maintaining the distinction between shall and will. \n\nRead, and discover a book whose pop culture references, humorous asides, and bracing doses of discernment and common sense convey YagodaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique sense of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbeauty, the joy, the artistry, and the fun of language.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n256 pages \nPublisher: Broadway (December 26, 2007) \nLanguage: English \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01d264fcf2ee7c5ab5ee71fa104f53d2e244de7","amp;dn":"When+You+Catch+an+Adjective%2C+Kill+It+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01d264fcf2ee7c5ab5ee71fa104f53d2e244de7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,29,38,79,207,46,231,197,171,94,231,31,161,4,245,61,46,36,77,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
