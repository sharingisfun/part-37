Through Faith is how all Christians are saved yet most Christians are of different denominations with differing Faith's! This highlights the biggest problem affecting Christian's today. We are commanded to be of &quot;One Faith&quot;, so whay are most Christians so varied in &quot;Faith&quot;? Seldonly preached correctly from the pulpit, learn what the Christian faith is and what should it embody for salvation. This sermon is highly recommended for all. God bless.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIdentity Crisis - Passion for Truth Ministries:\r\nDiscover Your True Biblical Identity.  There is a supernatural awakening happening in these last days! Christians around the world have been given a divine invitation from the Holy Spirit to come back to the roots of their faith. Like the prodigal son, Godâ€™s people are returning home to their Father, leaving behind the doctrines and denominations of man, and embracing their true identity!\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Solomon, the nation of Israel was split into two kingdoms. Both of these kingdoms were exiled into the nations because of their disobedience, but only oneâ€”the southern Kingdomâ€”maintained its identity and returned to the land. What happened to the northern Kingdom? Where are the lost tribes? Now, with the advent of Christ, does it even matter? Has Israel been replaced by â€œthe church?â€ Is God no longer the God of Israel? Finally, how do Gentile Believers fit in to all of this?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004868e4e421fa7dbadd66dce959d719f6246992","amp;dn":"The+Bible+-+Walking+by+Faith+in+the+Armory+of+Truth+Part+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004868e4e421fa7dbadd66dce959d719f6246992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,72,104,228,228,33,250,125,186,221,102,220,233,89,215,25,246,36,105,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
