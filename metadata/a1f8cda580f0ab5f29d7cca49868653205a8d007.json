Unlike other posts, these are not the individual drivers for each component - this is the entire installer.  Thus, all drivers are included, Windows XP, Windows Vista, 32bit, and 64bit. I personally tested this on Windows XP 32bit.   \n\nAll files are small enough to be used on a FAT partition, meaning no nonsense with moving files between partitions.  You also don't need to install ISO extractors, or image mounters to use this.  You just need to make sure you can extract a folder out of a ZIP file.  That is all.  \n\nI can't guarantee that it will autorun from your burned CD or flash drive, but all you have to do is open the folder and run the setup.exe file.  \n\nThere are no links, ads, spyware, or viruses.  It is a straight rip.
