However, it seems she just can't stay dead, and Miller himself (despite a complicated relationship with the character) as well as others have resurrected her from time to time. She has proven quite popular over the years and has had an ongoing series twice as well as her own feature film, subsequent to her appearance in the Daredevil movie. This torrent collects the first major arc of her character and nearly all of her appearances in one-shots, minis, and TPBs over the years. Her later appearances in Daredevil, Thunderbolts, and other regular-run comics are not featured, and I am missing the 2004-2005 minseries &quot;The Hand&quot; from this collection. Other than that, though, it's quite a lot of material! Included are the following:\n\n-Daredevil Visionaries - Frank Miller, Volume 2 (1982-1983) - The first appearance of Elektra and her first major storyline as well.\n-Elektra Saga #1-4 (Marvel Comics, 1984) (drawn from previously published material)\n-Elektra: Assassin #1-8 (Marvel Comics, 1986, with Bill Sienkewicz)\n-Elektra Lives Again original graphic novel (Marvel Comics / Epic Comics, 1990)\n-Elektra: Root of Evil #1-4 (Marvel Comics, 1995)\n-Elektra Megazine #1-2 (Marvel Comics, 1996, reprint series)\n-Elektra vol. 1, #1-19 (Marvel Comics, 1996Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1998)\n-Elektra vol. 1, #-1 (Marvel Comics, 1997, &quot;FlashBack Month&quot; issue)\n-Peter Parker: Spider-Man / Elektra '98 Annual (Marvel Comics, 1998)\n-Elektra vol. 2, #1-35 (Marvel Comics / Marvel Knights, 2001Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2004)\n-Elektra and Wolverine: The Redeemer #1-3 (Marvel Comics, 2002)\n-Elektra: Glimpse &amp; Echo #1-4 (Marvel Comics / Marvel Knights, 2002)\n-Dark Reign: Elektra #1-5 (Marvel Comics, 2009)\n-Shadowland: Elektra one-shot (Marvel Comics, 2010)\n-Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra #1-4 (Marvel Comics, 2002)\n-Ultimate Elektra #1-5 (Marvel Comics, 2004)\n-Elektra / Cyblade one-shot (Marvel Comics / Top Cow Productions, 1997)\n-Witchblade / Elektra one-shot (Top Cow Productions / Marvel Comics, 1997)\n\nAll credit to the original scanners and uploaders, I used a bunch of different sources on this one.
