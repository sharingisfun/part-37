When Deuce, Fade, Stalker and Tegan set out, the odds are against them. But the odds have been stacked against Deuce from the moment she was born. She might not be a Huntress anymore, but she doesn't run. With her knives in hand and her companions at her side, she will not falter, whether fighting for her life or Fade's love.\n\nAhead, the battle of a lifetime awaits. Freaks are everywhere, attacking settlements, setting up scouts, perimeters, and patrols. There hasn't been a war like this in centuries, and humans have forgotten how to stand and fight. Unless Deuce can lead them.\n\nThis time, however, more than the fate of a single enclave or outpost hangs in the balance. This time, Deuce carries the banner for the survival of all humanity.\nGenre: Sci-Fi/Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fefda1640d88ae741578dfa05e40a5f9f38a06c","amp;dn":"Horde+%28Enclave+Series%29+-+Ann+Aguirre.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fefda1640d88ae741578dfa05e40a5f9f38a06c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,239,218,22,64,216,138,231,65,87,141,250,5,228,10,95,159,56,160,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
