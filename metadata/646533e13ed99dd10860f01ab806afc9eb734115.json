Several small sections have been added on Mie series scattering by a PEC sphere; wedge diffraction by a wedge with surface impedances; and curve surface diffraction. Throughout the book, there are more helpful examples, end-of-chapter problems, and references as well as lecture notes in PowerPoint format. The revised edition also features MATLAB programs to animate some of the wave phenomena such as: propagation, reflection and refraction by planar interfaces; scattering by PEC circular cylinder, dielectric circular cylinder, dielectric coated PEC circular cylinder, and PEC sphere; and wedge defraction by 2-D PEC wedge.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1018 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley; 2 edition (January 24, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0470589485\n# ISBN-13: 978-0470589489","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:646533e13ed99dd10860f01ab806afc9eb734115","amp;dn":"Advanced+Engineering+Electromagnetics%2C2nd+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"646533e13ed99dd10860f01ab806afc9eb734115","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,101,51,225,62,217,157,209,8,96,240,26,184,6,175,201,235,115,65,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
