But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter.\n\nCast: Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow), Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa), Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), Jack Davenport (Norrington), Jonathan Pryce (Governor Weatherby Swann), Lee Arenberg (Pintel), Mackenzie Crook (Ragetti)... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/fullcredits#cast\n\nSoundtrack: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/soundtrack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIDEAL USE [DIRECT FROM PC to TV] - DVI or VGA CONNECTORS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c86be8b248328987c2d751d414d4a166ea63b87d","amp;dn":"Pirates.of.the.Caribbean%5B2003%5DDVDRip.x264-m99m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c86be8b248328987c2d751d414d4a166ea63b87d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,107,232,178,72,50,137,135,194,215,81,212,20,212,161,102,234,99,184,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
