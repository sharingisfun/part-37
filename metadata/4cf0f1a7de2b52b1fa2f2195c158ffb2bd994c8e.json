On Narrow Stairs, the Death Cab frontman sang songs like You Could Do Better Than Me and Pity and Fear, filling the album with the sort of articulate, hyper-literate gloominess you might expect from a depressed poetry major. Codes and Keys, released three years after Narrow Stairs and two years after his marriage to Deschanel, paints a brighter picture. Gone are the breakup ballads, the odes to lost love, the down-in-the-dumps sentiment that filled most of Death Cabs earlier work. Instead, the album offers up a handful of odes to the sunny side of life.\n\nTracks: \n\n 1. Home Is a Fire\n 2. Codes and Keys\n 3. Some Boys\n 4. Doors Unlocked and Open\n 5. You Are a Tourist\n 6.
