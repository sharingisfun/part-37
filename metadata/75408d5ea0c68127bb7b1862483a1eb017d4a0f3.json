Totally appropriate content for kids aged 4-9. Beautiful hand-drawn backgrounds, with a poem listing small hidden objects that the kids have to find amid the backdrop. Finding these objects guides the player through various nicely rendered stories which include launching a rocket ship, find a mermaid's treasure, or saving a princess locked up in a castle. Kids do not need to know how to read, since clicking on a poem or parts of it causes it to be read out loud (and hence also helps reading skills). A heartwarming and inspired work from the golden age of 2D.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75408d5ea0c68127bb7b1862483a1eb017d4a0f3","amp;dn":"I+Spy+Fantasy+Kids%27+Video+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75408d5ea0c68127bb7b1862483a1eb017d4a0f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,64,141,94,160,198,129,39,187,123,24,98,72,58,30,176,23,212,160,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
