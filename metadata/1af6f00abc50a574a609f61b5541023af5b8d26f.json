Lanier asserts that the rise of digital networks led our economy into recession and decimated the middle class. Now, as technology flattens more and more industriesÃ¢â‚¬â€from media to medicine to manufacturingÃ¢â‚¬â€we are facing even greater challenges to employment and personal wealth.\n\nBut there is an alternative to allowing technology to own our future. In this ambitious and deeply humane book, Lanier charts the path toward a new information economy that will stabilize the middle class and allow it to grow. It is time for ordinary people to be rewarded for what they do and share on the web.\n\nInsightful, original, and provocative, Who Owns the Future? is necessary reading for everyone who lives a part of their lives online.\n\nFILE TYPE: PDF/EPUB/MOBI\nSIZE: 6.5MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1af6f00abc50a574a609f61b5541023af5b8d26f","amp;dn":"Who+owns+the+future%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1af6f00abc50a574a609f61b5541023af5b8d26f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,246,240,10,188,80,165,116,166,9,246,27,85,65,2,58,245,184,210,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
