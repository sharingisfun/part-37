Beneath the earthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crust, over millions of years creatures have disintegrated and decayed until taking on ghastly new life as petroleum. Like a return of the undead, petroleum and its derivates have wrought cross-cultural conflict, environmental pollution, and economic distress. With a visual and aural assault, Sadek's new work &quot;In The Flesh&quot; re-interprets petroleum's sinister insinuation into our everyday lives. Nine songs and a series of original drawings video works explore several aspects of the commodified resource we find ourselves fatally dependent on.\n\n&quot;In the Flesh&quot; exploits the sonic links between death metal and gasoline-dependent heavy machinery such as automobile and airplane engines. These links shaped the process of musical composition itself: The album opener, &quot;Petrophilia&quot;, kicks in with a sound evoking an engine starting up. Another song, &quot;Of This Flesh (novus deus)&quot;, follows the sonic structure of a car shifting gears. While continuing to link musical composition to mechanical transformations, other songs depart from engine-based\nreferences. The outro to the album, &quot;Nigredo in Necromance&quot; which is already accompanied by a video, dwells on an individualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recognition that he must die in order to reunite with his deceased lover. The song riffs on the life-in-death of an oil-drenched society, as the loversÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reunite in their decomposition and rebirth as petroleum. This theme also drives the track &quot;Mechanic Idolatry&quot;, which channels the uncanny thrust of SadekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent artistic output, as live human beings provide the fuel for machines transforming themselves into flesh.\n\nQuote:\nIf you were to search for an architect, an architect who can mould body-slamming rhythms and destructive brutality into one solid blast of unforgiving Death Metal, then your attention should firstly be directed to Nader Sadek. The genius behind the multinational assembly of musicians has once again amassed a rally of songs that are guaranteed to deliver neurological pain as quickly and brutally as hydrochloric acid burns through skin. With Flo Mounier (Cryptopsy), Rune Eriksen (Aura Noir) and Travis Ryan (Cattle Decapitation) locking horns with Bobby Koelble (Death), Andreas Kisser (Sepultura) and Carmen Simoes (Moonspell), the feeling that the forthcoming EP 'The Malefic: Chapter III' will ignite and spread like wildfire is completely evident, just get the first aid kits at the ready, for this is certified to make you bleed from every orifice.\n\nFor Fans of: Suffocation, Behemoth, Cryptopsy\n\n'The Malefic: Chapter III' is out 3rd November 2014 via an independent release\n\n[8.5] RHYS STEVENSON\n\n[img][/img]\n\n\nLine-up:\n\nTravis Ryan - Vocals (Cattle Decapitation)\nRune Eriksen - Guitars (Aura Noir)\nMartin Rygiel - Bass (Ex-Decapitated)\nFlo Mounier - Drums (Cryptopsy)\n\n\nNader Sadek - The Malefic: Chapter III [ep] (2014)\n\n\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
