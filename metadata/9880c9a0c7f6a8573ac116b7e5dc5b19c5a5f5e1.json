This book aims to present illustrations of the various mathematical techniques as tools as well as means to an end.\r\nOrganized into eight chapters, this book begins with an overview of the various aspects of the transfer of a single solute between two immiscible phases in counter-current flow. This text then describes all possible factors and obtains their relationship to the extraction factor and number of stages or transfer units. Other chapters consider the flows and concentrations in counter-current forward and back extraction. This book discusses as well the optimization of forward and back extraction using counter-current flow in differential and stagewise extractors. The final chapter deals with further applications of counter-current extractions.\r\nUndergraduates and researchers involved in the design and operation of counter-current extractors will find this book useful","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9880c9a0c7f6a8573ac116b7e5dc5b19c5a5f5e1","amp;dn":"Counter-Current+Extraction+-+Stanley+Hartland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9880c9a0c7f6a8573ac116b7e5dc5b19c5a5f5e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,128,201,160,199,246,168,87,58,193,22,183,229,220,91,25,197,165,245,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
