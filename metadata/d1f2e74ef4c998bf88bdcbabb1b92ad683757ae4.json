The album's a loving tribute to Carl B. Stokes, the first black mayor of a major American city (Cleveland) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it's one of the strongest in a series of African-American culture albums by the Flying Dutchman label at the time. Side one of the record features a press conference with Stokes, in which he outlines his ideas for revitalizing the Cleveland area. But even better is side two Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which features a beautiful original composition by Nelson, entitled &quot;A Black Suite For String Quartet &amp; Jazz Orchestra&quot;, and which features recitations by Stokes of material by Langston Hughes and Gil Scott-Heron. The whole thing's great Ã¢â‚¬â€œ extremely powerful and progressive, with tracks that include &quot;Paint It Black&quot;, &quot;I Too Sing America&quot;, &quot;Mother To Son&quot;, &quot;Sit Down&quot;, and &quot;I Dream A World&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f2e74ef4c998bf88bdcbabb1b92ad683757ae4","amp;dn":"Carl+B+Stokes%2FOliver+Nelson+-+The+Mayor+And+The+People+%5B1970%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f2e74ef4c998bf88bdcbabb1b92ad683757ae4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,242,231,78,244,201,152,191,136,189,203,171,177,185,42,214,131,117,122,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
