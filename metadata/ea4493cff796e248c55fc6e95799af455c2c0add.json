It covers the care for truncal injuries (head, chest, abdomen) and fracture care of the extremities, the pelvis and the spine in a condensed fashion. Unlike previous, anatomically oriented outlines, this combines the anatomic location with frequent injury combinations. It is written for orthopedic and trauma surgeons, offering them a condensed outline of fracture treatment. In addition, all aspects of trauma care are covered, including associated injuries that may alter the decision making in patients with polytrauma.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea4493cff796e248c55fc6e95799af455c2c0add","amp;dn":"The+Poly-Traumatized+Patient+with+Fractures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea4493cff796e248c55fc6e95799af455c2c0add","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,68,147,207,247,150,226,72,197,95,198,233,87,153,175,69,92,44,10,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
