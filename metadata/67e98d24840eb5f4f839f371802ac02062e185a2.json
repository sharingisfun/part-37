It is a call-in and variety show hosted by Chris Gethard that airs every Wednesday night at 11:00PM on MNN and on a live stream at the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website. The Public access television show is written and produced by Noah Forman, Dru Johnston, J.D. Amato and Chris Gethard. It is directed by J.D. Amato. The show, known for its &quot;no cool kids&quot; atmosphere, has been called &quot;oddly uplifting&quot;, a &quot;cult hit,&quot; &quot;an often riveting experiment in seat-of-your-pants broadcasting,&quot; and has gained viewers from around the world. On November 20, 2013, it was announced that Comedy Central had ordered a pilot for prospective addition to their lineup.\n\n\nGet more at\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e98d24840eb5f4f839f371802ac02062e185a2","amp;dn":"The+Chris+Gethard+Show+-+Episode+%23124+MNN+Live+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67e98d24840eb5f4f839f371802ac02062e185a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,233,141,36,132,14,181,244,248,57,243,113,128,42,192,32,98,225,133,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
