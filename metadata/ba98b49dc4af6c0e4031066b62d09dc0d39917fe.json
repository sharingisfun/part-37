After their third album, Mickie Jones was replaced with Felix Robinson. Punky Meadows and Mickie Jones had previously recorded an album with the band BUX in the early '70's. This band also featured vocalist Ralph Morman who went on to record with the Joe Perry Project. Angel began as a progressive glam-rock band and progressed into a more melodic pop rock band by the early 1980's.\nIn 1982 the band fell apart with not much heard from most of the members. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria went on to form Giuffria then House of Lords. The band, while never officially &quot;breaking up&quot; came together in 1999 and put out a new studio album titled &quot;In the Beginning.&quot; The disc featured most of the original members, but did not include Greg.\nnolifetilmetal.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba98b49dc4af6c0e4031066b62d09dc0d39917fe","amp;dn":"Angel+-+6+Albums+%281975-80%2F2011%29+Japan+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba98b49dc4af6c0e4031066b62d09dc0d39917fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,152,180,157,196,175,108,14,64,49,6,107,98,208,157,192,211,153,23,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
