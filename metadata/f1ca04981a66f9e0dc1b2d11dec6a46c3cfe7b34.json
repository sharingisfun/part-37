Lee Ermey[Full Metal Kacket], Ely Pouget[Death Machine],&amp; Ray Wise[Robocop].\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1ca04981a66f9e0dc1b2d11dec6a46c3cfe7b34","amp;dn":"The+Rift+1990+%5BHyperdrive25%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1ca04981a66f9e0dc1b2d11dec6a46c3cfe7b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,202,4,152,26,102,249,224,220,27,45,17,222,198,164,108,60,254,123,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
