Over six hours of Satie? Definitely yes. If you have an affinity for Satie\\'s classic pieces you should not pass up this set. There are so many standout pieces in so many wonderful styles you can only leave this set with wonder. And Thibaudet seems made for this music. The best interpreter of Satie that I\\'ve heard. His technique is amazing with such a range of subtle fingering tempo and dynamics. Its as though I\\'ve heard some of these for the first time with new shocks of emotion I hadn\\'t experienced before. Not to be missed.
