In each episode the WotWots help children to celebrate and understand the diversity of the animal world. They recognise kindness and co-operation as core values, delight in learning new words and enjoy exploring their creativity through drawing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd01f4f5ef405527982defb068a18a3e6ea0e005","amp;dn":"The+WotWots+-+Ready+to+Rumble","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd01f4f5ef405527982defb068a18a3e6ea0e005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,1,244,245,239,64,85,39,152,45,239,176,104,161,138,62,110,160,224,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
