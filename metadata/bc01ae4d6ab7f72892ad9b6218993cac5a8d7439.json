Written by Erin Morgenstern; Read by Adjoa Andoh. Abridged.\n\nThe circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªves, and it is only open at night.\n\nBut behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway - a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc01ae4d6ab7f72892ad9b6218993cac5a8d7439","amp;dn":"Winter+Tales+-+series+2+%28Erin+Morgenstern%5C%27s+The+Night+Circus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc01ae4d6ab7f72892ad9b6218993cac5a8d7439","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,1,174,77,106,183,247,40,146,173,155,98,24,153,60,172,90,141,116,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
