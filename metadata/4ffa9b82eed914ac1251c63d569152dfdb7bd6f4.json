Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n - fixed Spacefox graphics (new raw/objects/*)\n - changed to have Vanilla keybindings by default\n - updated Legends Viewer; minor bugfix\n - changed keybindings to match 40_05 vanilla; tracking @514 k-&gt;K, log @1307 e-&gt;g\n** updated Dwarf Fortress to 40_06\n - updated ASCII default graphics to 40_06\n - updated Phoebus graphics to 40_06v01\n - updated Ironhand (unofficial) graphics to 40_06\n - removed CLA, Mayday graphics to avoid save incompatibility (40_06 has more raw chnages)\n - updated default inits, reinstalled embark profiles, bumped version numbers, repointed soundsense config, etc\n - updated Spacefox graphics to 40_06 v1\n - added Dwarf Therapist memory layout for 40_06\n\nMD5: 73BEA1423495587A4ECCF49DB65E90C3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ffa9b82eed914ac1251c63d569152dfdb7bd6f4","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_06+Starter+Pack+r1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ffa9b82eed914ac1251c63d569152dfdb7bd6f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,250,155,130,238,217,20,172,18,81,198,61,86,145,82,223,219,123,214,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
