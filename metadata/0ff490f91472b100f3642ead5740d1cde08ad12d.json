But this is the first episode which functions as one.\n\nGene Barry played the boss Glenn Howard, owner of Howard Publications -- whose main magazines were &quot;People&quot; and Robert Stack as a former FBI agent who was editor of &quot;Crime&quot; magazine. Susan's character Peggy Maxwell was a research assistant who worked with all 3 men and other editors in the same company. ( Hey, there was no Internet back then. ) The regulars took turns filming each show, because this is a long-form crime drama. COZI TV edited these a bit though, from 72 or 73 minutes down to 70 minutes.\n\nGuest Stars -- Robert Webber, Jeanne Crain, Claudine Longet, Zsa Zsa Gabor, \nJohn Payne, Anthony Eisley, and Russell Thorson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ff490f91472b100f3642ead5740d1cde08ad12d","amp;dn":"THE+NAME+OF+THE+GAME+--+Fear+of+High+Places+%28+series+premiere+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ff490f91472b100f3642ead5740d1cde08ad12d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,244,144,249,20,114,177,0,243,100,46,173,87,64,209,205,224,138,209,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
