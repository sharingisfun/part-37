I'll change your life (1997). Snog's third LP (sorta) sounds nothing like its predecessors, which was nice. \n\nFormat: FLAC\n\n\n1  Light, Yet Refreshing\n2  Hooray!!\n3  Make The Little Flowers Grow\n4  The Ballad\n5  The Prole Song\n6  Big Brother\n7  This Is Capitalism\n8  The Human Germ\n9  Bastard Closet\n10  The Future\n11  The People Of Straight Land\n12  The End (Suite)\n\n\nAs for the copyright question (like you care), this time there's a Ã‚Â© marker in the CD case's back, but it's Snog's own IMCC holding it. Hmm.\n\n\nBand info, once again courtesy of Wikipedia:Snog is a band that was formed by Australian musician David Thrussell, along with fellow art school friends Tim McGrath and Julia Bourke in 1989. The band's music is a fusion of many different styles, including industrial, techno, ambient, experimental, funk and country music. The band name is a reference to &quot;kissing and cuddling,&quot; and Thrussell has stated that the name symbolizes the Marxist concept of destroying barriers between people. Thrussell's songs frequently contain themes of anti-capitalism, anti-fascism, anti-consumerism, individuality and anti-big-brotherism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b61326ba16613540f09cf4a5a4a6814860be9955","amp;dn":"Snog+-+Buy+me...+I%27ll+change+your+life+1997+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b61326ba16613540f09cf4a5a4a6814860be9955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,19,38,186,22,97,53,64,240,156,244,165,164,166,129,72,96,190,153,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
