After making a name for itself playing very European-sounding synth pop, the L.A. trio recruited producer Bob Ezrin (known for his work with Alice Cooper and others) and unveiled a more hard-edged, guitar-oriented sound. From the rockin' &quot;Trash&quot; (which features none other than Ted Nugent -- the last person one would expect to work with Berlin!) to the ballad &quot;Pink and Velvet&quot; (a tale of two heroin addicts' romance that is as poignant as it is disturbing), Count Three &amp; Pray leaves no doubt just how much lead singer Terri Nunn and her colleagues were enjoying this radical change. But sadly, record buyers weren't ready for it. Despite the inclusion of the hauntingly pretty number one hit &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; (included in the film Top Gun) the album didn't sell nearly as well as Pleasure Victim or Love Life. Geffen was bitterly disappointed, and Berlin soon broke up..\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Will I Ever Understand You\n[02] You Don't Know\n[03] Like Flames\n[04] Heartstrings\n[05] Take My Breath Away\n[06] Trash\n[07] When Love Goes To War\n[08] Hideaway\n[09] Sex Me, Talk Me\n[10] Pink And Velvet\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:47m:07s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 312mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
