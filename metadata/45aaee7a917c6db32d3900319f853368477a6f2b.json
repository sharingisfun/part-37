For Phillipe it is love, but for Claude it seems to be only a passing relation. When Phillipe discovers Claude kissing a girl, his despair drives both of the boys apart. Phillipe is distraught, and finally comes to rely on payment to be close to Claude, a solution that provides little relief to his pain.\n\nA beautiful short film. The relationship between the two boys is displayed very tenderly including a couple intimate and very cute scenes.\n\nDIRECTOR: Jaques Duron\nPRINCIPAL ACTORS: Phillipe Bories, Bernard Flamain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45aaee7a917c6db32d3900319f853368477a6f2b","amp;dn":"Une+Histoire+Sans+Importance+1980+%28with+Eng+subtitles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45aaee7a917c6db32d3900319f853368477a6f2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,170,238,122,145,124,109,179,45,57,0,49,159,133,51,104,71,122,111,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
