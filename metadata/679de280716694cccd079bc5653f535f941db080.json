The book is an analysis of the ways that political interests shape discourse about genocide. It consists of case studies of Cambodia, Bangladesh, the Ottoman Armenians, the Holocaust and a comparative study of the concept of genocide provocation as applied to the Armenians, and Tutsis.\n\nReview\n'The Genocide Debate is a thoughtful and well-researched critique of the manner in which American academics have approached the study of mass atrocity. It offers an accessible overview of the structure and origins of the most heated controversies in the field, and - by raising questions as to the objectivity of existing scholarship - challenges the academy to elevate and broaden its discourse...' - Journal of International Criminal Justice\n\nBook Description\nThis book explores the political constraints and imperatives that motivate debates about genocide in the academic world and, to a lesser extent, in the political arena.\n\nAbout the Author\nDONALD W.
