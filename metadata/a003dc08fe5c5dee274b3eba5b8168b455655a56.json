The current edition also includes comparative information that will prove a valuable resource to practicioners, including diagnostic pathologistis and toxicologists.\n\nNOW FEATURING:\n\n. 25% brand new information, fully revised throughout\n\n. New chapters: Veterinary Diagnostic Toxicologic Pathology; Clinical Pathology; Nomenclature: Terminology for Morphologic Alterations; Techniques in Toxicologic Pathology\n\n. New color photomicrographs detailing specific toxicant-induced diseases in animals\n\n. Mechanistic information integrated from both toxicology and pathology discussing basic mechanisms of toxic injury and morphologic expression at the subcellular, cellular, and tissue levels\n\n\n# Hardcover: 700 pages\n# Publisher: Academic Press; 2 edition (November 30, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0123704693\n# ISBN-13: 978-0123704696","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a003dc08fe5c5dee274b3eba5b8168b455655a56","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Toxicologic+Pathology%2C2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a003dc08fe5c5dee274b3eba5b8168b455655a56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,3,220,8,254,92,93,238,39,75,62,186,91,129,104,180,85,101,90,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
