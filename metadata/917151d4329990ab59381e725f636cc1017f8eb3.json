A series set in the present day (then the early 1980&amp;#039;s), it explores the escape of NAZI officers from a defeated Germany and their subsequent rise through the industrial and business world some 40 years later.\n\nEpisode One: Four people arrive in Brussels. Their object - the identification and unmasking of one man: SS Standartenfuhrer Ludwig Kessler.\n\nEpisode Two: The Circle around Manfred Dorf, once Ludwig Kessler, is narrowing and his flight from Germany is imminent - but there is something he must take with him.\n\nEpisode Three: Even in England no one is safe from the NAZI tentacles - but neither are the NAZI&amp;#039;s safe. The time has come to seek permanent sanctuary.\n\n\nSpoken : English\n\nSub : Mono\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:917151d4329990ab59381e725f636cc1017f8eb3","amp;dn":"Kessler+1981+Mini+Disc+1+%283%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"917151d4329990ab59381e725f636cc1017f8eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,113,81,212,50,153,144,171,89,56,30,114,95,99,108,193,1,127,142,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
