The nature of the game William Gravel's playing is revealed. He has a process for discovering who killed Avalon Lake, and it's as brutally logical as you'd expect from an SAS man. The problem is that all the members of the Major Seven are more powerful than him and have been magicians for a lot longer. How does one man affect a group who are more numerous and more deadly? Well, that's pretty much what the SAS was invented for!
