This is, in my opinion, some of the greatest chamber music ever written.  This magisterial collection received the Chamber Music Recording of the Year from Gramophone magazine in 1979. Once you listen to it, you will understand why.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:756b3f7d91331cc932c06adaf0f41b91ad97f895","amp;dn":"Haydn+-+The+Piano+Trios+-+Beaux+Arts+Trio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"756b3f7d91331cc932c06adaf0f41b91ad97f895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,107,63,125,145,51,28,201,50,192,106,218,240,244,27,145,173,151,248,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
