This is my first torrent. I've download quite a few amazing pieces of music on here, so I decided its time I contribute back to the community beyond seeding. This is a really awesome band,and I haven't seen this full album download anywhere. You might have heard a few of these songs but never knew the name. It has particularly exploded after a youtuber uploaded some battlefield 3 montages with these songs. So, I decided to buy the album and put together the torrent. I honestly think this will do more good than harm to the band, give them so exposure finally. I think I got all the tagging right, and its in 320kbps quality so sounds pretty great. Its not a rip, but bought online. Also put in a high resolution (not sure if thats good or bad) album cover. Enjoy! Let me know if I made any mistakes. \n\nTrack List:\n1. Big personality (Really good)\n2. The Right Attitude\n3. Burstin' Bubble\n4. Soul Company\n5. How High\n6. Been out of town\n7. Stuck at the bottom\n8. Exit!\n9. Something I understand\n10. Bow Down (Also very good)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41be8e917a32bdb4591defe0d4250146f7f6c7c5","amp;dn":"Hogni-+Hare%21+Hare%21+%5BMP3%5D+%5B320+Kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41be8e917a32bdb4591defe0d4250146f7f6c7c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,190,142,145,122,50,189,180,89,29,239,224,212,37,1,70,247,246,199,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
