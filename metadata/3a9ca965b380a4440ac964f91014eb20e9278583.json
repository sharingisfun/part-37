The band originally consisted of two brothers, Mato Nanji (Maiari) ('mah-TOE non-GEE' vocals and guitar, born 1974), Pte ('peh-TAY' bass guitar), along with their sister, Wanbdi ('wan-ba-DEE' drums, vocals), and their cousin, Horse (percussion).\nTheir music is heavily influenced by guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, as well as Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana. Mato Nanji's style and skill has drawn comparisons to each of these guitarists. The band has also shared the stage with artists of varying musical genres such as B.B. King, Santana, Bonnie Raitt, Joan Baez, the Indigo Girls, Jackson Browne, Dave Matthews Band, and Los Lonely Boys. The band has headlined its own tours several times.\n\n Things We Do (Pachyderm Records, 1998)\nNative American Music Award for Album of the Year, Group of the Year, and Best Pop Group\nBlues This Morning EP (Pachyderm, 1999)\nLive at Pachyderm Studios (Pachyderm, 1999)\nNative American Music Award for Blues Album of the Year, Group of the Year\nCircle (Pachyderm, 2000)\n#3 Billboard Top Blues Albums\nIndigenous (Zomba/Silvertone, 2003)\n#3 Billboard Top Blues Albums\nLong Way Home EP (Indigenous Records, 2005)\nChasing the Sun (Vanguard, 2006)\n#2 Billboard Top Blues Albums\nBroken Lands (Vanguard, 2008)\nThe Acoustic Sessions (2010)\nIndigenous-Featuring Mato Nanji (2012)\nVanishing Americans (2013)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a9ca965b380a4440ac964f91014eb20e9278583","amp;dn":"Indigenous+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a9ca965b380a4440ac964f91014eb20e9278583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,156,169,101,179,128,164,68,10,201,100,249,16,20,235,32,233,39,133,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
