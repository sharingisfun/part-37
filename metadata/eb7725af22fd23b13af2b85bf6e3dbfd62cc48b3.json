Two or more yarns are worked at the same time to create intricate or simple motifs. One yarn is carried while the other yarn is worked over it. Depending on the tension and number of yarns carried, the finished fabric can be stiff or supple, and may take any flat or three-dimensional form. Tapestry crochet has the flexibility and portability of crochet, but the finished pieces look woven.\n\nThe tapestry crocheted shoulder bags of highland Guatemala and the hats of Cameroon inspired the wide variety of flat and three-dimensional projects in this book. Instructions are included for both right-handed and left-handed crocheters. Besides full instructions, information is shared about the history of tapestry crochet around the world and special graph papers and instructions help readers to design their own projects and motifs!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb7725af22fd23b13af2b85bf6e3dbfd62cc48b3","amp;dn":"Ventura+Carol+-+More+Tapestry+Crochet+-+2014.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb7725af22fd23b13af2b85bf6e3dbfd62cc48b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,119,37,175,34,253,35,177,58,242,184,91,246,227,219,253,98,204,72,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
