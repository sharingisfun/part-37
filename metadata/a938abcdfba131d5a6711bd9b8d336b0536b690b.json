Oh that great piece on album so and so. Its great but you never play it. Its too long for the audience and such a hustle when you are alone. Same with me.\n\nSo I thought lets list these pieces and see whether I could play them in some quite moments when you have the time to listen to music. Not 3 or 4 minutes but real Rock Symphony`s greater than 7 minutes (Brother in Arms is exactly 7 minutes).\n\nSo I made five 2-hour playlists (A148-152) and now I play these wonderful compositions once in while (nice). If anyone has some suggestions for monumental Rock Projects I missed?. For some good candidates, like Valentyn Suite and Supper's Ready (Genesis), I could not find a proper recording. Please put them on the net if you have one of these.... Enjoy,\n\nPS: I skipped a few good tracks like Bohemian Rhapsody and Stairway to Heaven (too well known).\n\n\nDutch Treat - ^A152 Reflection (Symphonic Rock)\n\n01 The Smashing Pumpkins - Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans\n02 Yes - And You And I Cord Of LifeEclipseThe Preacher The TeacherApocalypse\n03 Creedence Clearwater Revival - I Heard It Through The Grapevine\n04 Tool - Reflection\n05 Stone Temple Pilots - Kitchen Ware &amp; Candy Bars\n06 New Cool Collective - One More Time\n07 Steely Dan - Aja\n08 Genesis - Firth Of Fifth\n09 Genesis - The Fountain Of Salmacis\n10 Dave Matthews Band - The Dreaming Tree\n11 Peter Frampton - Do You Feel Like I Do\n12 The Blues - Lonely World\n13 Oasis - All Around The World\n14 Riverside - The Curtain Falls\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a938abcdfba131d5a6711bd9b8d336b0536b690b","amp;dn":"VA+Rock+Symphony%60s+-+Reflection+%28Dutch+Treat+%5EA152+VBR+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a938abcdfba131d5a6711bd9b8d336b0536b690b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,56,171,205,251,161,49,213,166,113,27,217,184,211,54,176,83,107,105,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
