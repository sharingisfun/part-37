All credit goes to whoever originally uploaded this! It plays great on my 2007 MacBook Pro, although it does have a few mouse-look problems. It has Rebirth Mod and Tacticool Weapon Replacement Mod installed. Niether of those mods change the gameplay, just makes it look nicer.\n\n                         -----Install Instructions-----    \n\nOpen the .DMG and drag and drop the System Shock 2 Folder anywhere on your computer\nIf you need any help feel free to post your question in the comment section and ill try my best to help\n\n             \n                              Seed and Enjoy!!!\n\n                                   -Toasty","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a9297f27448b1422ac4b5bb66849f6f656ed51b","amp;dn":"System+Shock+2+OSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a9297f27448b1422ac4b5bb66849f6f656ed51b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,146,151,242,116,72,177,66,42,196,181,187,102,132,159,111,101,110,213,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
