On Ã¢â‚¬Å“Autumn LeavesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ they combine their approaches, producing a delicious friction of the traditional and modern. Berg and Aalefjaer set up a jagged interplay on the intro to which Lien weds a respectful, yet rather swift rendition of the melody. Later Berg follows LienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lead in a swinging bowed solo, one that Aalefjaer tries his best to disrupt with surprising accents.\nSuch swift changes encapsulate the trioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two-pronged method: cleave close to tradition to keep the music accessible, but push the limits enough to give the improvisations an edge. LienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“FurulokkaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ unabashedly expresses a rich sentimentality. Lien luxuriates the lullaby melody with subtle dissonances, while Berg quietly counterpoints and Aalefjaer paints the background with airy cymbal splashes and broad gong strokes. On other pieces, like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mann Av Huse ForbiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hypotek,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lien strips the melodic content to a naked core, and Berg and Aalefjaer accordingly create a spare pulse. Such a minimalism results in a contemplative restraint layered with a dark urgency.\nAmongst all the press heaped on the Norwegian fusions of electronica and jazz, LienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elegant acoustic space has been overlooked. A shame, but unfortunately not a surprise. Unlike the dance floor pleasing throb of some, the Helge Lien trioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subtle refraction of the piano trio takes time to appreciate, and will definitely reward repeated listening.
