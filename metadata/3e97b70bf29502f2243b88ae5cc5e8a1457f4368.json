Given its origins, it's little wonder that The Wall paints such an unsympathetic portrait of the rock star, cleverly named &quot;Pink,&quot; who blames everyone -- particularly women -- for his neuroses. Such lyrical and thematic shortcomings may have been forgivable if the album had a killer batch of songs, but Waters took his operatic inclinations to heart, constructing the album as a series of fragments that are held together by larger numbers like &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;Hey You.&quot; Generally, the fully developed songs are among the finest of Pink Floyd's later work, but The Wall is primarily a triumph of production: Its seamless surface, blending melodic fragments and sound effects, makes the musical shortcomings and questionable lyrics easy to ignore. But if The Wall is examined in depth, it falls apart, since it doesn't offer enough great songs to support its ambition, and its self-serving message and shiny production seem like relics of the late-'70s Me Generation. \n \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n CD1 \n \n 01.In the flesh [03:20] \n 02.The thin ice [02:30] \n 03.Another brick in the wall [03:10] \n part 1 \n 04.The happiest days of our [01:51] \n lives \n 05.Another brick in the wall [04:00] \n part 2 \n 06.Mother [05:37] \n 07.Goodbye blue sky [02:48] \n 08.Empty spaces [02:08] \n 09.Young lust [03:31] \n 10.One of my turns [03:38] \n 11.Don't leave me now [04:17] \n 12.Another brick in the wall [01:15] \n part 3 \n 13.Goodbye cruel world [01:17] \n \n CD2 \n \n 01.Hey you [04:42] \n 02.Is there anybody out there [02:41] \n 03.Nobody home [03:25] \n 04.Vera [01:34] \n 05.Bring the boys back home [01:27] \n 06.Comfortably numb [06:24] \n 07.The show must go on [01:36] \n 08.In the flesh [04:18] \n 09.Run like hell [04:25] \n 10.Waiting for the worms [03:58] \n 11.Stop [00:31] \n 12.The trial [05:20] \n 13.Outside the wall [01:44] \n ____ \n81:27 min\n113,1 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e97b70bf29502f2243b88ae5cc5e8a1457f4368","amp;dn":"Pink_Floyd-The_Wall-2CD-%28Retail%29-1979-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e97b70bf29502f2243b88ae5cc5e8a1457f4368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,151,183,11,242,149,2,242,36,59,136,174,92,197,232,161,69,127,67,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
