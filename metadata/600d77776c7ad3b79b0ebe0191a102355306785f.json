In addition to Jazz at the Philharmonic jams (&quot;I Can't Get Started&quot; clocks in at over nine minutes), collaborations with orchestras led by Machito, Joe Lippman, Jimmy Carroll, and Neal Hefti, Bird is heard in the company of the best modern jazzmen of the day. By virtue of the excellent material compiled herein, this potent package rates as one of the best entries in Verve's Jazz Masters series. ~ arwulf arwulf, All Music Guide \n\nI am untutored when it comes knowing jazz,I bought this album on the strength of one cut from the encyclopedia sized compilation called THE VERVE STORY, Repetition, Disc#1. \nThis album is like opening a window into another spirit dimension. \nJazz and with it American culture was in such flux at that time. This album, with widely various styles recalls that sense of flux that resides in us still, that still seeks the eternal and makes jazz relevant today. That transformative presence is well enough mapped out in this set of recordings for me to begin to understand the man:immortal artist and tortured soul,both come out quite strongly. The sound recording is quite good for the time it was done.The label is quality. This is one of the longest running CDs I have, so its value. ~ John Feesey\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 15 - Charlie Parker Tracks:\n01  Confirmation 3:02 \n02  An Oscar For Treadwell 3:26 \n03  Dancing In The Dark 3:23 \n04  Segment 3:23 \n05  Star Eyes 3:31 \n06  Mango Mangue 2:56 \n07  Repetition 2:59 \n08  The Bird 4:48 \n09  K.C.
