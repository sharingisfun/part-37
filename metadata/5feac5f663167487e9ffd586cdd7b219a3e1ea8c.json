Their music documented the rage and despair that led, eventually, to the L.A. riots in the aftermath of the Rodney King beating.\n\nIn 1989, the FBI went after them on the pretext that their music incited violence against police. Such actions seriously backfired - the more negative press they received, the more records they sold. Even after Ice Cube left, their second full-length album went to #1 on the Billboard charts - the first hardcore rap album to do so.\n\nTheir music captured a moment in time for young black men growing up in the inner cities - maybe things have changed since then, but I doubt it.\n\nThis documentary tells the story of their rise to fame - and it's narrated by Chris Rock (VH1, 2008).\n\n(ctrl+c+v from)\n\n\n\n\nNWA: The WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Most Dangerous Group tells the story of a group of childhood friends from Compton who channeled the rage of the streets through the prism of rap music and pop culture. Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice-Cube, MC Ren and DJ Yella gave a powerful voice to the late-80Ã¢â‚¬Â²s Compton ghetto that was on the verge of exploding, and in the process scared the hell out of White America. We also show you new interviews with Ice Cube, DJ Yella, Eazy-EÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow Tamika Wright, former manager Jerry Heller, Ice-T, and director John Singleton. Supplemented by rarely-seen footage and interviews of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early days, photos, and music, the documentary will show how gangsta rap was born in late 80s Los Angeles, a city torn by drugs and violenceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and how a nation grew to fear the music that emerged.\n\n(from http://www.vh1.com/shows/vh1_rock_docs/episode.jhtml?episodeID=142813 )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5feac5f663167487e9ffd586cdd7b219a3e1ea8c","amp;dn":"VH1+Rock+Docs+-+NWA+The+World%27s+Most+Dangerous+Group","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5feac5f663167487e9ffd586cdd7b219a3e1ea8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,234,197,246,99,22,116,135,233,255,213,134,205,215,178,25,163,225,234,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
