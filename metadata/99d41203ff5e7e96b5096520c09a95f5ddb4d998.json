First up is Sweet &amp; Soulful Sounds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a wonderful mellow trio session from Bobby Ã¢â‚¬â€œ done with a spare, relaxed approach that's a nice contrast to the recordings he was making for Prestige around the same time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but which still has the same deep, soulful approach to the piano that makes those records so great! Half a dozen trio numbers with Sam Jones and Roy McCurdy are rounded out with two piano solos, &quot;God Bless The Child&quot; and &quot;Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ both of which present Bobby in an especially introspective mode, one you don't hear that often on record! Remaining trio tunes include &quot;The Sweetest Sounds&quot;, &quot;Turn Left&quot;, &quot;You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To&quot;, &quot;Another Live One&quot;, &quot;Alone Together&quot;, and &quot;Why Was I Born&quot;. Born To Be Blue is one of Bobby Timmons' most obscure trio sessions from the early years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ recorded at the tail end of the Riverside years, which is probably why the album disappeared so quickly! The set's in a similar format to some of Bobby's other records for Riverside Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a trio set with either Sam Jones or Ron Carter on bass, and Connie Kay on drums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but it's different in that Bobby's a bit more introspective Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;blue&quot;, if you will Ã¢â‚¬â€œ working in less of the gutbucket soul jazz mode than before, and really hitting some lyrical magic on the keys! The album includes the original tunes &quot;Know Not One&quot;, &quot;Often Annie&quot;, and &quot;The Sit In&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plus a great reading of Tom McIntosh's &quot;With Malice Towards None&quot;.
