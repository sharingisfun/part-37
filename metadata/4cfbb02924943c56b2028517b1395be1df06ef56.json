He traces the common roots of British and American liberty, and describes how both countries are losing their inheritance as government crowds out the private sphere. He calls for a renewed commitment to the Anglosphere: the alliance of free, English-speaking nations which has preserved freedom in our time.\n\nAuthor: Daniel Hannan\nPublisher: Encounter Books\nPublication Date: March 1, 2011\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cfbb02924943c56b2028517b1395be1df06ef56","amp;dn":"Daniel+Hannan+-+Why+America+Must+Not+Follow+Europe+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cfbb02924943c56b2028517b1395be1df06ef56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,251,176,41,36,148,60,86,178,2,133,23,177,57,91,225,223,6,239,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
