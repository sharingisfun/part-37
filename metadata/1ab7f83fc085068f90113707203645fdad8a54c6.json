It&amp;#039;s 1969 and Mary Banner is a bookish, unpopular girl who has unexpectedly been invited to the dance by a star athlete. His intentions are less than admirable, however, and after trying to escape from him Mary suffers a long and painful death. Years later in 2005, Sam (Kate Mara) and her girlfriends are having a slumber party on prom night, and while discussing urban legends and local lore, they invoke Mary&amp;#039;s name and bring her back from the dead. This sets off a string of local murders, each executed according to the dictates of a different urban legend. Sam and her brother David (Robert Vito) take it upon themselves to investigate, researching the original crime in an attempt to thwart the revenge the wronged spirit is determined to see through.\n\nFile     :  1.36 GB (1.36 GB),  duration: 1:29:18,  type: AVI,  1 audio stream(s),  quality: 84 %, , \nVideo :  1.08 GB,  1744 Kbps,  25.0 fps,  720*384 (16:9),  DX50 = DivXNetworks Divx v5,    Supported\nAudio :  286 MB,  448 Kbps,  48000 Hz,  6 channels,  0x2000 = AC-3 ACM Codec,  CBR, ,   Supported\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451957/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451957/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll films ripped using AnyDVD &amp; DVDShrink and converted to divx using Dr Divx\nAll screenshots are taken using SnatchIt! \nAll information was taken using AVIcodec \n\nTHIS IS A DAVELAMBOONA TORRENT \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab7f83fc085068f90113707203645fdad8a54c6","amp;dn":"The+Urban+Legends+Collection+Parts+1%2C2%2C3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab7f83fc085068f90113707203645fdad8a54c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,183,248,63,192,133,6,143,144,17,55,7,32,54,69,253,173,138,84,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
