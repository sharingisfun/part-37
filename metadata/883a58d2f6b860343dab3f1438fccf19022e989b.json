While the film included Donovan's recordings of the songs, the accompanying soundtrack included none of Donovan's original recordings. The absence of these recordings prompted many of Donovan's fans to request an official release of the songs.\n\nIn order to satisfy demand, Donovan embarked on acquiring the rights to the original recordings. Due to the nature of the original contract and complex publishing rights issues, it became evident to Donovan that releasing the original Brother Sun Sister Moon recordings would be extremely difficult. In the absence of this release, Donovan decided to record new versions of the original songs and release it exclusively through the iTunes Music Store.\n\nFor the new recordings, Donovan opted not to recreate the lush orchestration and choir vocals of the original recordings. Instead, he plays guitar and sings solo, in a style reminiscent of his Sutras album.\n\n01 A Soldier's Dream (00.00).mp3\n02 Instrumental (00.05).mp3\n03 Gloria in Excelsis Deo (00.09).mp3\n04 Instrumental (00.10).mp3\n05 Lullaby (00.12).mp3\n06 Instrumental (00.14).mp3\n07 The Lovely Day (00.16).mp3\n08 Instrumental (00.21).mp3\n09 God Bless the Master of this House (00.26).mp3\n10 Choral (00.32).mp3\n11 Brother Sun Sister Moon II (00.35).mp3\n12 Instrumental Brother Sun Sister Moon (00.47).mp3\n13 The little church (solo) (00.54).mp3\n14 For Sister Poverty, we give thanks (01.09).mp3\n15 Lullaby II (01.10).mp3\n16 Prayer of Saint Francis (01.18).mp3\n17 The little church (01.24).mp3\n18 Shape In The Sky (01.26).mp3\n19 Choral (01.37).mp3\n20 Gloria in Excelsis Deo (01.52).mp3\n21 Brother Sun and Sister Moon III (01.53).mp3\n\nI did some work in ripping and editing the songs from the DVD: Fade in and out and normalizing. The sound is now much better than what you got with the mp3 collection. CouldnÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t delete noisy wind and rain sounds, some voiceovers still in. \n\nAt least weÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´ve got 21 songs, 192kbps mp3, tagged as good as my research was succesfull. If somebody knows the names of the gregorian chants or the female singer of lullaby (i tagged actress Valentina Cortese) please tell us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:883a58d2f6b860343dab3f1438fccf19022e989b","amp;dn":"Donova+-+Brother+Sun+Sister+Moon+%281972%29+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"883a58d2f6b860343dab3f1438fccf19022e989b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,58,88,210,246,184,96,52,61,171,63,20,56,252,207,25,2,46,152,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
