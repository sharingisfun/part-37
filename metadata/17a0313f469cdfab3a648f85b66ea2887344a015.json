My only source has been a CD rip and I simply cant get the wretched thing to play straight forwardly without so much of sliceing and dicing. ie. it plays file one of cd1 then file one of cd 2 - it gets the matrix on it's side. Confusing much?\n\nIn any event I am recompiling M'sC using ffmpeg. Midnight's children available on a single mp3 file only, for all to enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a0313f469cdfab3a648f85b66ea2887344a015","amp;dn":"Midnight%27s+Children+-+Salman+Rushdie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a0313f469cdfab3a648f85b66ea2887344a015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,160,49,63,70,156,223,171,58,100,143,133,182,110,162,136,115,68,160,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
