Also, it seems to me that collectively, with true expressive makers of rock music, we have been building the external Temple Of Rock for many years and have now come to the point of putting on the roofing and celebrating the almost completion of the Temple. \nAll generations of this period are meeting all over the world on one stage it seems celebrating an era of &quot;hand make rock&quot;, which will never be the same again due to invention of new technology but of course New Temples and New Wonders will arise to enjoy expressions in new waysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nYou like Michael Voss vocals or not, but the man has helped to make this material sounding cohesive and vital, not only on the arrangements, particularly on the production department. Has been passed many years since a Michael Schenker album sounded that good.\nTaking a look back to Schenker classic albums of the '80s, &quot;Temple Of Rock&quot; includes pretty good rockin' tunes, with nice hooks and catchy choruses.\nRanging from melodious rockers such as &quot;Miss Claustrophobia&quot; (one of my favorites), &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; or &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, to more old school harder tracks as &quot;The End Of An Era&quot;, the great &quot;Before The Devil Knows You're Dead&quot; (with a welcomed Doggie White on lead vocals), or &quot;Storming In&quot;, here is something for everyone.\nAlso, if you're looking for ballads, you have the bluesy &quot;With You&quot;, and also there's room, of course, for the guitar frantics on both versions of &quot;How Long&quot;.\n\n\nIn 2011 Michael celebrates his 40th jubilee as a recording artist.\nAnd &quot;Temple Of Rock&quot; makes justice to his (tumultuous) career.\nIt is distinguished by an immense enthusiasm for guitar, including the participation of an incredible list of international superstars (check personnel).\nThe punchy and compelling production helps to enjoy this entertaining album, where most the tracks are good and fun to listen.\nMichael Schenker and his new line up already completed a very successful UK Tour in July 2011 and a great Show at LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s High Voltage Festival being joined by surprise guests such as Rudolf Schenker, Doogie White and Jeff Scott Soto.\nIn October Michael Schenker will be touring the States with Leslie West and Uli Jon Roth under the name '3 Guitar Heroes'.\nGood.\n\n\n01 - Intro\n02 - How Long\n03 - Fallen Angel\n04 - Hanging On\n05 - The End Of An Era\n06 - Miss Claustrophobia (Album Version)\n07 - With You\n08 - Before The Devil Knows You're Dead\n09 - Storming In\n10 - Scene Of Crime\n11 - Saturday Night\n12 - Lover's Sinfony\n13 - Speed\n14 - How Long (3 Generations Guitar-Battle Version)\n15 - Remember (Japan Bonus Track)\n\n\nMichael Schenker - Guitars\nMichael Voss (Mad Max, Casanova) - Vocals\nHerman Rarebell (ex Scorpions) - Drums\nPete Way (ex UFO) - Bass\nWayne Findlay (MSG) - Keyboards\n\nGuests:\nRudolf Schenker (Scorpions) - Guitar\nWilliam Shatner (Captain Kirk from Star Trek) - Intro Vocals\nLeslie West - Guitar\nDoogie White - Vocals\nRobin McAuley - Vocals\nDon Airey - Keyboards\nChris Glenn (ex MSG) - Bass\nNeil Murray (ex Whitesnake) - Bass\nPaul Raymond ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ UFO (ex MSG)\nSimon Phillips - Drums\nCarmine Appice - Drums\nChris Slade (ex AC/DC) - Drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f00e53ff3c0f656722ae9776b690ef3d981fba12","amp;dn":"Michael+Schenker+-+Temple+of+rock+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f00e53ff3c0f656722ae9776b690ef3d981fba12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,14,83,255,60,15,101,103,34,174,151,118,182,144,239,61,152,31,186,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
