This solution is not based on politics, morality, laws, or any other &quot;establishment&quot; notions of human affairs, but rather on a modern, non-superstitious based understanding of what we are and how we align with nature, to which we are a part. The work advocates a new social system which is updated to present day knowledge, highly influenced by the life long work of Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project.\n\n\nRun Time: 2 hrs 3 min\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.tv\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ceea4641682c4bf78ab322e4c595d25deeaa65b","amp;dn":"Zeitgeist+II+-+Addendum+-+HIGHLY+RECOMMENDED+%5BAVI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ceea4641682c4bf78ab322e4c595d25deeaa65b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,238,164,100,22,130,196,191,120,171,50,46,76,89,93,37,222,234,166,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
