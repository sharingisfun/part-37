The story deals with a squadron of bombers who receive a go code as a result of a mechanical error. The rest of the movie is filled with anticipation and tension as the president tries to convince the Russian premier that the bombers are there because of a mistake, and the only way to preserve Moscow is to destroy the bombers. To talk about this movie to those who haven't seen it would ruin the story. What I can say is that once you start watching, you will not be able to turn away. The acting from all the performers keeps you watching as they propel the action forward. The black and white format gives it a feel of reality, and the omission of music adds to the effect . You know it's fiction but something in the back of your mind says that this could happen, and thus you're compelled to watch. For those who didn't see this in April, watch for a re-airing. Better yet, wait till it hits the home video circuit. That way, you'll be able to watch this captivating, tension filled, nailbiter with no interruptions.\n\n(comment at imdb.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f40ec32a1005c97f37d3f5049c2e56fec3f5e1","amp;dn":"Fail+Safe+%282000%29%2C+nuclear+war+theme.asf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f40ec32a1005c97f37d3f5049c2e56fec3f5e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,244,14,195,42,16,5,201,127,55,211,245,4,156,46,86,254,195,245,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
