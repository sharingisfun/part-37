And while it&amp;#039;s true The Clash will always be associated with\nthe British punk scene of the 1970s, their sound has proven to be\nway ahead of its time and still manages to sound cutting-edge no\nmatter what generation digs on it. This collection of performances\nfrom across their entire career will remind fans why The Clash are\none of the most important, and perhaps best sounding, bands in\nrock history. Included here is footage from studio recordings;\nfamed London venues; and a massive, stage-rocking extravaganza\nheld at Shea Stadium.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:437692f61909852c76df3d21bef7f113db75255d","amp;dn":"The_Clash-Revolution_Rock-%28DVD%29-2008-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"437692f61909852c76df3d21bef7f113db75255d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,118,146,246,25,9,133,44,118,223,61,33,190,247,241,19,219,117,37,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
