It was recorded on April 25, 1979, at CBS Studios in New York City with his band Prime Time, which featured guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Calvin Weston and Coleman's son Denardo. It followed Coleman's failed attempt to record a direct-to-disc session earlier in March 1979.\r\nOf Human Feelings explores jazz-funk music and continues Coleman's harmolodic approach to improvisation with Prime Time, whom he introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. He drew on rhythm and blues influences from early in his career for Of Human Feelings, which had shorter and more distinct compositions than Dancing in Your Head. Coleman also applied free jazz principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of funk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a884f329ccabc7367fcaa50f7213555de98f0694","amp;dn":"Ornette+Coleman+-+Of+Human+Feelings+%5BFlac%5D%5BTNT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a884f329ccabc7367fcaa50f7213555de98f0694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,132,243,41,204,171,199,54,127,202,165,15,114,19,85,93,233,143,6,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
