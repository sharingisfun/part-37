The Son of Sam. The Boston Strangler. Albert Fish. Henry Lee Lucas. The DNA of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most notorious serial killers has been cloned by the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a new breed of bioweapon. Now in Phase Three, the program includes dozens of young men who have no clue as to their evil heritage. Playing a twisted game of nature vs. nurture, scientists raise some of the clones with loving families and others in abusive circumstances. But everything changes when the most dangerous boys are set free by their creator. A man with demons of his own, former black ops soldier Shawn Castillo is hot on their trail. But Castillo didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t count on the quiet young man he finds hiding in an abandoned house Ã¢â‚¬â€ a boy who has just learned he is the clone of Jeffrey Dahmer. As Jeffrey and Castillo race across the country on the trail of the rampaging teens, Castillo must protect the boy who is the embodiment of his biggest fears Ã¢â‚¬â€ and who may also be his last hope. Melding all-too-plausible science and ripped-from-the-headlines horror, CainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blood is a stunning debut about the potential for good and evil in us all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea567462a00f4761770310a54bea293e9d3e9cb","amp;dn":"Cains+Blood+-+Geoffrey+Girard+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea567462a00f4761770310a54bea293e9d3e9cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,165,103,70,42,0,244,118,23,112,49,10,84,190,162,147,233,211,233,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
