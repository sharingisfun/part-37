Funded by oil heiress Sylvina Boissannas, the Zanzibar directors were free to pursue their exoticized experimentation and singular visions without commercial concerns. Deval's film can be read as an aftershock of May '68, the film and its band of outsiders seeking to, as Bataille once suggested, cut off the head of man. As one young dandy lectures to an audience: &quot;We must change completely, or cease to exist altogether.&quot; But the film tempers this prescription with pessimism: the group of youth the film focuses on spends much of the time imprisoned underground, tossed by society into the &quot;garbage.&quot; One individual says, &quot;I swear, in two years time we will have the whole earth in convulsions.&quot; The film's style and its characters remain on this side of the threshold of the proposed utopia. But through the smallest of gestures - such as the conclusion, which is nothing more than a smile - the film compellingly gestures toward that which continues to exceed its vision. \n\n\nRip specs:\n\n\nVÃƒÂ­deo: DVD Rip\nContainer: MKV\nVÃƒÂ­deo Codec: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nVÃƒÂ­deo Bitrate: 1700 Kbps\nÃƒï¿½udio Codec: AC3\nÃƒï¿½udio Bitrate: 192 Kbps\nResoluÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o: 710 X 464\nAspect Ratio: 1.632\nFormato de Tela: Widescreen (16x9)\nFrame Rate: 25.000 FPS\n\n\nMy rip, enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab095459a5fc92912176ea88bff74c947ca8d56d","amp;dn":"Ac%26eacute%3Bphale+-+Patrick+Deval+-+1968","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab095459a5fc92912176ea88bff74c947ca8d56d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,9,84,89,165,252,146,145,33,118,234,136,191,247,76,148,124,168,213,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
