Hank was one of the very few people allowed behind the curtain. He was with Tiger 110 days a year, spoke to him over 200 days a year, and stayed at his home up to 30 days a year, observing him in nearly every circumstance: at tournaments, on the practice range, over meals, with his wife, Elin, and relaxing with friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a979b2bc8350af4aad9742a852a828c3a51340","amp;dn":"The+Big+Mess.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a979b2bc8350af4aad9742a852a828c3a51340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,169,121,178,188,131,80,175,74,173,151,66,168,82,168,40,195,165,19,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
