This ability, seen most profoundly in individual, startling moments of genius - or equally startling moments of chance - is what separates humans from the animals and allows humans to re-imagine the world in ever more complex designs. From the earliest ideas, including cannibalism and the idea of farming, to theories of relativity and chaos, ideas reshape the world in surprising and wholly unexpected ways. Science, agriculture, religion, art, politics - Professor FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Armesto examines all these areas of thought and the moments in time when man's fertile intellect produced the sparks that set off blazes of change, even revolutions, that would forever alter the course of human history.\nLecture 1 The Idea of Ideas \n\nLecture 2 The Mind of the Hunter \n\nLecture 3 Of Ice and Mud \n\nLecture 4 From Settlement to Civilization \n\nLecture 5 Thus Spake Zarathustra \n\nLecture 6 The Age of Sages: Politics and Knowledge \n\nLecture 7 The Age of Sages: Religion \n\nLecture 8 Ideas About Religion \n\nLecture 9 The Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution\n\nLecture 10 The Enlightenment \n\nLecture 11 The Nineteenth Century \n\nLecture 12 A Century of Horrors \n\nLecture 13 The Restoration of Chaos \n\nLecture 14 The Age of Uncertainty \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=========================================================\n\n&quot;Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, \nand the life of the candle will not be shortened.&quot;\n\n\n-- KNOWLEDGE never decreases by being shared!!\n\n\nShow your Thankfulness by seeding :)\n\n=========================================================\n\n\nIf you can afford, &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.learnoutloud.com/Audio-Books/Philosophy/History-of-Philosophy/Ideas-that-Shaped-Mankind/30819&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.learnoutloud.com/Audio-Books/Philosophy/History-of-Philosophy/Ideas-that-Shaped-Mankind/30819&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Ideas-Shaped-Mankind-Felipe-Fernandez-Armesto/dp/1402582048&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Ideas-Shaped-Mankind-Felipe-Fernandez-Armesto/dp/1402582048&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e142ff463a1a0d0a59399b69eb3ed9e5eed7a4c2","amp;dn":"Great+Ideas+that+Shaped+Mankind+-+TMS+Lectures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e142ff463a1a0d0a59399b69eb3ed9e5eed7a4c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,66,255,70,58,26,13,10,89,57,155,105,235,62,217,229,238,215,164,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
