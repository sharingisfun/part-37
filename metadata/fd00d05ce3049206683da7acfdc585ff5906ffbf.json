I Don't Want To Wait\n\n\nAmazon Review:\nAfter a promising but overlooked debut album, Paula Cole kept the bills paid with a fateful stint as Peter Gabriel's vocal foil on his 1994 Secret World tour. Gabriel's immersion in richly theatrical, primal vocals only magnified Cole's already fevered attack; it's obvious that his sense of adventure as a producer and writer also struck conceptual sparks with the Massachusetts singer-songwriter. This Fire, Cole's self-produced 1996 breakthrough, finds her investing her songs with outsized emotions, framed by consistently inventive arrangements built around Cole's keyboards, and reaching a zeitgeist-piercing intensity on &quot;Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want to Wait,&quot; making Cole seem very much like Fiona Apple's older, slightly less cracked sister.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nPaula Cole's songwriting and musical skills sharpened considerably on her second album, This Fire. Occasionally, she flirts a little too closely with Sarah McLachlan territory, but Cole has developed her own, subtly mature style, equally informed by textured electronics, light worldbeat influences, and soul-baring lyrics. &quot;Where Have All the Cowboys Gone&quot; may epitomize the sound of the album, but it only scratches the surface of what This Fire has to offer. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd00d05ce3049206683da7acfdc585ff5906ffbf","amp;dn":"Paula+Cole+-+This+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd00d05ce3049206683da7acfdc585ff5906ffbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,0,208,92,227,4,146,6,104,61,167,172,253,197,133,255,89,6,255,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
