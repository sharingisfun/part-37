All of the eight movies are audio described by Di Langford. The quality of the first three movies isn't great, because I had to take the audio from VHS tapes.\n\nPlease seed after you have finished downloading, because it's the only audio described Harry Potter torrent available. If anyone has any requests, I have loads of audio descrbed movies in MP3 format on my laptop, so feel free to request movies and do post a comment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79662c59ca1c34e6f9eb94fafedce8a00e6bc17e","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+-+The+Complete+Audio+Described+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79662c59ca1c34e6f9eb94fafedce8a00e6bc17e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,102,44,89,202,28,52,230,249,235,148,250,254,220,232,160,14,107,193,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
