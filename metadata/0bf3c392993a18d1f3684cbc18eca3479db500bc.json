Courage did not reuse the theme for the second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has gone Before,&quot; which introduced Captain Kirk. However, the theme was later added when the series' main title was tagged onto the final air version.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture\nEnd Title\n\nFor the first Star Trek feature film, in which the Enterprise crew encounters a sentient machine, Jerry Goldsmith was hired to create a lavishly major motion picture score. Besides writing a new theme for the starship, he also devised several weird musical motifs for the alien probe, V'Ger. The &quot;End Title&quot; features Goldsmith's versatile anthem and march--which over the years and numerous films has moved from a swaggering legato marking to the more abrasive, overtly military marcato marking--and the bewitching &quot;love theme&quot; for Ilia.\n\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine\nTheme (Concert Version)\n\nOrbiting the planet Bajor is a rundown space station, built by the Cardassians, hostile invaders who stripped the planet of all its natural resources. The Federation is brought in to manage Deep Space 9, and soon discover a wormhole nearby that will take them light years across the galaxy. Suddenly, Bajor is the doorstep of a new frontier. Dennis McCarthy's theme, which won an Emmy Award for best of the 1992-1993 season, relates the loneliness of this outpost and the exciting, dangerous mysteries that lay beyond. (This is the premiere recording of McCarthy's extended symphonic arrangement of his theme).\n\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine\nHe's Toast (from the episode &quot;Life Support&quot;)\n\nIn the third season episode &quot;Life Support,&quot; Dr. Bashir struggles to keep the dying Vedek Bareil alive during critical peace negotiations with the Cardassians. Injured in an accident aboard a transport ship, he is suffering severe brain damage and the doctor is forced to use a risky drug which causes his vital bodily organs to fail. Bashir must replace them with artificial parts. Eventually, the decision is made to let Bareil die rather than substituting the remaining portion of his brain. This ravishing, unadorned cue comes from the final scene where Major Kira bids farewell to her lover and reminisces about the first time they met.\n\nStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\nOverture\n\nAlthough a box office hit, the first Star Trek movie was not as big a success as the studio would have liked. Paramount turned to TV producer Harve Bennet to whip up an inexpensive &quot;little&quot; film that would capture all the elements of the TV series, including the physical action that was missing from the previous feature. The result was a financial triumph. Captain Kirk, mourning the loss of his youth, is forced into a battle to the death with TV nemesis Khan Noonian Singh over the ultimate weapon, the Genesis Device. This film first established James Horner as a major film music talent. He created a rousing score with a thrilling nautical feel, echoing Gene Roddenberry's promise that the original TV series would have the flavour of &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower in Outer Space.&quot; This overture combines sections of Horner's opening and closing titles.\n\nStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home\nEnd Title\n\nKirk and company time travel back to 20th Century San Francisco to find two humpback whales. Extinct 300 years in the future, they are needed to stop an alien probe from devastating the Earth. Composer Leonard Rosenman was given ample opportunities to exploit the comedic elements of the film's &quot;fish out of water&quot; premise, as our galaxy hopping Starfleet heroes find 1986 San Francisco more daunting then the Klingon homeworld. The most &quot;classical&quot; of all the Star Trek scores, Rosenman has an obvious affection for baroque music, even the inclusion of Handelian-style trumpets in his orchestration.\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation\nTasha's Farewell (from the episode &quot;Skin of Evil&quot;)\n\nSecurity Chief Tasha Yar is callously murdered by an alien creature composed of pure evil. After escaping its planet, the crew gathers for a memorial service where a holographic image of Tasha delivers her own eulogy. One of Ron Jones' most fondly remembered cues for the series, it deftly mixes orchestral and electronic instruments to simple yet stunning effect. Jones also composed the popular two-part episode, &quot;Best of Both Worlds.&quot;\n\nStar Trek V: The Final Frontier\nLife is a Dream\n\nUnlike his first voyage with the starship Enterprise's crew, Jerry Goldsmith had a wider variety of subject matter to score, from rock climbing, to an attack on a western-style frontier outpost, to a meeting with &quot;God.&quot; Despite the muddled finale of the film, the composer transcended the material time and again. The final orchestral cue of the movie reprises Goldsmith's main theme, and &quot;The Klingon Attack&quot; from Star Trek: The Motion Picture\n\nStar Trek: Voyager\nMain Title\n\nIn the third spin-off from the original TV series, the crew of the starship Voyager are snatched by a powerful alien force and marooned in a remote, hostile part of the galaxy. Jerry Goldsmith only composed the series main theme, which was supported by a powerful visual sequence. He garnered another Emmy Award for best theme of the 1994-1995 season.\n\nStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\nEnd Titles Suite\n\nThe final voyage of the original starship Enterprise finds the soon to be retired crew in delicate peace negotiations with the Klingons. Composed by newcomer Cliff Eidelman, the musical underscore has a decidedly shadowy, urgent tone, perfect for the crew's desperate attempt to unmask a plot to bring both sides to war. Originally, director Nicholas Meyer wanted to score the film, rather too obviously, with Gustav Holst's &quot;The Planets&quot; suite, but was unable to license the material for a reasonable fee.\n\nStar Trek Generations\nOverture\n\nThe crew of the Enterprise-D attempts to stop the mad Dr. Soren from destroying a star system in an attempt to re-enter the Nexus, a magical alternate universe where only your fondest desires exist. Captain Kirk, though killed in the Enterprise-B's first encounter with the Nexus, joins Captain Picard in a last ditch attempt to prevent the catastrophe. Dennis McCarthy's overture touches upon the strengths of both Star Trek eras with two adroitly written themes: One, a driving, surging, rhythmic theme full of space cruising excitement, the other, an ethereal and spectral melody for strings and choir with delicate electronic effects.\n\n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] 2001: A Space Odyssey\t\t- City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[02] Sound Affect - Apollo Lift-Off\t- Mark Ayres\n[03] Apollo 13 - Main Title\t\t- James Horner\n[04] The Right Stuff\t\t- Bill Conti\n[05] Sound Affect - Alien Protein Synthesis\t- Mark Ayres\n[06] Species\t\t\t- City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[07] Lifeforce\t\t\t- Henry Mancini\n[08] Sound Affect - The Nostromo\t- Mark Ayres\n[09] Alien\t\t\t- City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[10] Cpricorn One\t\t\t- City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[11] Cocoon\t\t\t- City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[12] Sound Affect - Warp Drive\t- Mark Ayres\n[13] The Black Hole\t\t- City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[14] Star Wars; Epidose V, The Empire Strikes Back (Han Solo &amp; The Princess)- City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[15] Heavy Metal - Taarna's Theme\t- City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[16] Sound Effect - Space Dogfight\t- Mark Ayres\n[17] Enemy Mine\t\t\t- City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[18] Close Encounters Of The Third Kind - The Conversation\t- Mark Ayres\n[19] Close Encounters Of The Third Kind - The Conversation Begins (Main Title &amp; Finale)\t- Mark Ayres\n\t\t\n\tDisc 01 - Play Time - 01h:14m:32s\n\n\nDisc 02\n\n[01] 2001: A Space Odyssey - Prelude: The Dawn Of Man\t- Alex North\n[02] 2001: A Space Odyssey - Space Station Docking\t- Alex North\n[03] Star Wars\t\t\t\t\t- John Williams\n[04] Warp Drive\t\t\t\t\t- SFX\n[05] Star Trek - TV Theme\t\t\t\t- Alexander Courage\n[06] Star Trek: The Motion Picture\t\t\t- Jerry Goldsmith\n[07] Away Team\t\t\t\t\t- SFX\n[08] Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\t\t\t- Dennis McCarthy\n[09] Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - He's Toast (Life Support)\t- Dennis McCarthy\n[10] The Bridge\t\t\t\t\t- SFX\n[11] Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Overture\t- James Horner\n[12] Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\t\t\t- Leonard Rosenman\n[13] Star Trek: The Next Generation - Tasha's Farewell (Skin Of Evil) - Ron Jones\n[14] Battle Stations\t\t\t\t- SFX\n[15] Star Trek V: The Final Frontier - Life is a Dream\t- Jerry Goldsmith\n[16] Star Trek: Voyager\t\t\t\t- Jerry Goldsmith\n[17] Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country - End Titles Suite\t- Nic Raine: City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n[18] Crash Landing\t\t\t\t\t- SFX\n[19] Star Trek Generations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Overture\t\t- Nic Raine: City Of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra\n\n\tDisc 01 - Play Time - 01h:04m:04s\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 02h:18m:38s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 338mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Soundtrack Classical\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 01 January 1996\n\nRecords Company    \t- Silva Screen Records\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * PLEASE SEED TO A RATIO OF 1:1 OR GREATER * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LL ONLY RE-SEED IF THERE IS MORE THAN 10 PEERS WAITING * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bf3c392993a18d1f3684cbc18eca3479db500bc","amp;dn":"%5B1996%5D+Space+%26+Beyond+-+Various+Artists+-+338mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bf3c392993a18d1f3684cbc18eca3479db500bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,243,195,146,153,58,24,209,243,104,76,188,24,236,163,71,157,181,0,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
