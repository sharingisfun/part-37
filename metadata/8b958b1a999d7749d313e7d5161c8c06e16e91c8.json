Having had some of the world's most successful chefs in his kitchens Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including Gordon Ramsay and Australia's own Shannon Bennett and Curtis Stone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ White will challenge, inspire and mentor the 18 professionals. By his side, ensuring that no element of the dish goes unnoticed, will be MasterChef AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perennial favourite, esteemed food critic Matt Preston.\n\nBe prepared to meet some of the country's most innovative and exciting chefs, competing to win a career-defining, money-can't buy experience.\n\nFor these qualified chefs, food is their world, their passion, their love.

While viewers will still see some of their favourite challenges and guest chefs, the experience and competition will be intensified. These are professional chefs and the challenges they will face reflect their experience. For viewers, that leaves only one thing to do: prepare to be taken to a whole new level.\n\nIn a MasterChef Professionals first, the Re-Invention Test gives contestants the opportunity to cook a classic dish but as the name suggests, it's re-invention not recreation that is the key. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b958b1a999d7749d313e7d5161c8c06e16e91c8","amp;dn":"MasterChef.The.Professionals.s01e04.WS.PTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b958b1a999d7749d313e7d5161c8c06e16e91c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,149,139,26,153,157,119,73,211,19,231,213,22,28,140,6,225,110,145,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
