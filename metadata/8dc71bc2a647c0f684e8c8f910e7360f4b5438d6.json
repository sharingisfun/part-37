Deniz, a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œregally placidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Variety) twenty-one-year-old, freelance actress is enlivened by the uncertainty that lays before her now that she has dumped her boyfriend, seemingly on a whim. With her brisk and confident strut, she appears out to conquer the world, her gaze sober, focused, and in search of that special someone, whom she may have found in her enigmatic neighbour Diego. A Fine Day is a sumptuously shot yet refreshingly economical, Rohmeresque moral tale (a direct nod is made to the French master when Deniz takes a job dubbing Un Conte dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©). The other influence is Pialat; a story Deniz recounts at an audition recalls his ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â€šÂ¬ nos amours, which featured an adolescent Sandrine Bonnaire also in search of first love. An ambulatory tendency is discernible in many of the Berlin School films, in which meandering city-searches become metaphors for charactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ states of longing and self-discovery. In this case, ArslanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s camera rarely strays from Deniz, framing her tightly as she strides through a Berlin in full summer bloom, its radiance matching hers. Punctuated with music by Morton Feldman, A Fine Day is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstrewn with the gentlest of ironies and coincidencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Eddie Cockrell, Variety) and is a pure delight.\n\nArslan's previous feature Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»DealerÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â« suggested a poised talent, a sure eye and a composed sensibility brought to bear on a 'still waters run deep' portrait surely inspired by Bresson. His follow-up maintains the promise, though the template has shifted towards Rohmer, with a meandering female protagonist (shown dubbing Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»A Summer's TaleÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â«), a good bit of talk and some string-pulling. A 'day in the life' snapshot, it's likewise reminiscent of prime Richard Linklater, in both its episodic linearity and its deployment of lop-sided set piece dialogue - as Deniz (Turhan) leaves her lover, surveys romantic plights with old family and friends, submits to a curiously sparse job audition, shares ideas with strangers and eyes up boys. It's a study of the proverbial hungry heart, profiled mostly through speech but also through Deniz's roving eye and the daily pattern of her peregrination. Not as substantial as the aforementioned models, mind, but lucid and definitely intriguing.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i370.photobucket.com/albums/oo143/lohmannn/thefineday_01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i370.photobucket.com/albums/oo143/lohmannn/thefineday_01.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i370.photobucket.com/albums/oo143/lohmannn/thefineday_02.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i370.photobucket.com/albums/oo143/lohmannn/thefineday_02.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i370.photobucket.com/albums/oo143/lohmannn/thefineday_04.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i370.photobucket.com/albums/oo143/lohmannn/thefineday_04.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i370.photobucket.com/albums/oo143/lohmannn/thefineday_06.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i370.photobucket.com/albums/oo143/lohmannn/thefineday_06.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------not my rip---------\n\n~~~~~~ Der schone Tag.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................853,122,218                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................FFmpeg/ffdshow ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:09:19                \n\nFrame Count:....................................103967             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................384                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.667                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1500                 \n\n......MPEG-4..............................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.244&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
