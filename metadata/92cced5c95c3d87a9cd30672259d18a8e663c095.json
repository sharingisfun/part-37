At the start of 2004, when Nick Cave took a small team of Bad Seeds members -- violinist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn Casey and drummer Jim Sclavunos -- off to the tiny MisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re studio in Paris for a songwriting session, they effectively established a new band. The small combo configuration of Nick, Warren, Marty and Jim had its public debut in a showcase performance to promote the Bad Seeds Nocturama album; the foursome continued working in this streamlined format, getting together frequently for Nick Cave \\&quot;solo\\&quot; tours. Born of babbling lyrics hatched from Bosch eggshells in the Hyde-bound apocalyptic margins of the Cave brain, the Grinderman sound is an instinctual yawlp that also resurrects the demons of each musician\\&amp;#039;s past: the trashcan proselytising of Birthday Party -era Nick; Sclavunos\\&amp;#039; late 70s New York no-wave noise wisdom; Martyn Casey\\&amp;#039;s ominous Triffids bass reverb; plus Ellis\\&amp;#039; avant-garde soundtrack work and his teenage love of Black Sabbath. Destination: Out! Grinderman sound different from everyone, including themselves. As Memphis Slim put it back in 1941, \\&quot;While everything is quiet and easy/ Mr. Grinder can have his way.\\&quot; It\\&amp;#039;s a new day. God help you all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92cced5c95c3d87a9cd30672259d18a8e663c095","amp;dn":"Grinderman+-+S%2FT+%282007+Advance%29+%3CNick+Cave%3E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92cced5c95c3d87a9cd30672259d18a8e663c095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,204,237,92,149,195,216,122,156,211,6,114,37,157,24,168,230,99,192,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
