That is how tvrage.com is doing it. Unfortunately, last week someone posted a mostly repeat episode labeled as S01E12 and I therefore posted an all-new file as S01E12 so that people would see it as the corrected version. If I were to call this weekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s episode S01E12 (which is literally correct) things would get even more confused. Right? \n\nThis week the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ episode contained 4 new skits and the following repeat episode contained one new skit. I have packaged all 5 skits together in this upload.\n\nOnce again, the program guide was completely messed up when it came to describing the contents of the episode(s).\n\nNote: I have boosted the sound level on this one. Let me know whether the volume is OK.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab2f4bba289c10ab921b24edc65eeca6c3561f64","amp;dn":"Howie.Do.It.S01E13.actually.ep12.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab2f4bba289c10ab921b24edc65eeca6c3561f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,47,75,186,40,156,16,171,146,27,36,237,198,94,236,166,195,86,31,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
