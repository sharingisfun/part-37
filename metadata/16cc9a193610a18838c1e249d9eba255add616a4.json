After I \nsaw them I figured out how to turn that off, so it won't happen again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16cc9a193610a18838c1e249d9eba255add616a4","amp;dn":"WAGON+TRAIN+--+The+Horace+Best+Story+%28+4th+Season+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16cc9a193610a18838c1e249d9eba255add616a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,204,154,25,54,16,161,136,56,193,226,73,217,235,162,85,173,214,22,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
