The group built up a loyal following touring the Southeast. They self-produced their first album even though they still had not landed a record deal. A song titled &quot;New Age Girl&quot; off of this self-published record became popular regionally and earned airplay in New Orleans and Atlanta. After receiving this airplay, the band landed a record deal with the independent label Ichiban Records. Ichiban released the group's debut album A Different Story in 1994. After its release, the song &quot;New Age Girl&quot; was selected for inclusion on the Dumb and Dumber feature film soundtrack. The publicity from the film caused the song to become a national hit, peaking at No. 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1995. The band released their second album, Whirl, in 1995 but were unable to reproduce the success produced by &quot;New Age Girl&quot;. Deadeye Dick later disbanded. Caleb Guillotte and Mark Miller continue to remain active in the local New Orleans music scene as producers.\n\nTrack list:\n\n01 New Age Girl\n02 Perfect Family\n03 Your Love Is Killing Me\n04 Marguerite\n05 The Oath\n06 Anyone\n07 Sentimental Crap\n08 Like a Shadow\n09 Molly\n10 Different Story\n11 Lucky One","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9d645423d12d4548d8be4de83ea88ee3423c2a5","amp;dn":"Deadeye+Dick+A+Different+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9d645423d12d4548d8be4de83ea88ee3423c2a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,214,69,66,61,18,212,84,141,139,228,222,131,234,136,238,52,35,194,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
