Well, Tim Bushong, after a few years away from the limelight, has returned to the scene with a whole new line up and sound in the form of The Channel Surfers. 'Tunnel Vision', the band's debut album, is a rich and diverse blend of sonic intensity; ranging from laid back funk influenced tones, through to full on, in your face rap-core...sometimes even within the same piece. Deftly produced and executed, the listener is left without any doubt as to The Surfers' proficient execution of the material contained herein. Variety is the spice of life, so the saying goes; I cannot help but feel, however, that with such an eclectic influence being incorporated within their sound, the Surfers are spreading themselves a tad thin in terms of identity. This small quibble aside, 'Tunnel Vision' stands as a fine set of well crafted and thoroughly enjoyable compositions.\n\nFrom http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/The_Channel_Surfers/Tunnel_Vision/420/\n\n-------------\n\n1.
