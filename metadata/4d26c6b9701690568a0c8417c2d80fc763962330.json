Without evidence of involvement in property damage, the NGO activists were sued for threatening the political system and economy. A special task force put them under surveillance for two years, kicked down their doors, and took them to jail at gunpoint. After three months in prison and a 14 month trial all of them were acquitted. Despite this, many of the activists face financial ruin now. The director Gerald Igor Hauzenberger followed one of AustriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important trials with his camera.\n\nAustria, 2012, 112min/1,85:1, DCP \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d26c6b9701690568a0c8417c2d80fc763962330","amp;dn":"Der+Prozess+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d26c6b9701690568a0c8417c2d80fc763962330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,38,198,185,112,22,144,86,138,12,132,23,194,216,15,199,99,150,35,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
