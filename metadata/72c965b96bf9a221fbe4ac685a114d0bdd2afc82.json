Watch in awe as Bear heads deep into the heart of tiger territory, the Sumatran jungle, abseils down a treacherous waterfall, battles relentless downpours, hunts stingrays and builds a raft out of old driftwood in an attempt to make it off the desert island and back to civilization... all in the name of survival.\n\n\n\n######################################################################\n\n Genre: .......
