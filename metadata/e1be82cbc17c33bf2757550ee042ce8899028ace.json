Really, we do recommend them for this game.\n\nKey features include:\n\n- Auto fire - this is primarily intended as an accessibility option and allows the player to not have to worry about using a fire button.\n- Quick fire - don't like mashing buttons/keys, then this is for you. Press and hold to fire.\nColour blind filter - this filter adjusts the game thereby making it more colour blind friendly. We just hope we have got it right!\n- Six levels of intense shooting action.\n- Original music score.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nv1.0.2 changes:\ntilt controls\nvisual feedback on enemy hit\nhaptic feedback on player hit\nv1.0.3 changes:\noption to turn off haptic feedback\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BBQGames.Tiamat_X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BBQGames.Tiamat_X&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1be82cbc17c33bf2757550ee042ce8899028ace","amp;dn":"Tiamat+X+v1.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1be82cbc17c33bf2757550ee042ce8899028ace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,190,130,203,193,124,51,191,39,87,85,14,224,66,206,136,153,2,138,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
