Both the 3DS and Wii-U versions allow players to use their respective touch screens to switch between secondary items without pausing the game. The 3DS version features an exclusive mode known as StreetPass arena. This involves the player recording a short section of movement, which is then distributed to other players via StreetPass, where they can fight against that player's recorded character. Additionally, a Shovel Knight Amiibo figure, released on 2016-01-08 in North America, allows players to unlock a co-op mode in the Wii-U version, as well as challenge stages and customizeable gear in both the Wii-U and 3DS versions.\r\n\r\nThis is a single .3ds file inside of a .7z archive file..\r\n\r\nYou will need a gateway card (or some kind of CFW) to run it on your 3DS..\r\nAlso, make sure your gateway software is updated to the newest version..\r\nAt the time of this writing you need to have your sysnand on 9.2.0 or lower.. However if you have 10.3 or lower, there is a way that you can downgrade your sysnand to 9.2.0. (You will need to research it on a site like gbatemp.net to figure out how to do it).. But if you are on sysnand 10.4 or higher, it is not possible (at the time of this writing) to downgrade or hack your 3DS with out using a hardware-modified 3DS and a back-up of your NAND before it was updated in to an unhackable version range..\r\n\r\nI have confirmed it to work at least with this set up:\r\nnew-3DS\r\nsysnand: 9.2.0\r\nemunand: 10.4.0\r\ngateway launcher software version: 3.7.1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3231fb73b06a294cf79ff64d10a1108c10a5bd47","amp;dn":"%5B3DS%5D+Shovel+Knight+%5BUSA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3231fb73b06a294cf79ff64d10a1108c10a5bd47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,49,251,115,176,106,41,76,247,159,246,77,16,161,16,140,16,165,189,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
