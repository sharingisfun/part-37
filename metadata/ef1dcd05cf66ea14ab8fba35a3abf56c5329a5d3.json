Now reissued on CD in the OJC series, Mitchell is heard in excellent form in an all-star sextet with trombonist Curtis Fuller, tenor great Johnny Griffin, pianist Wynton Kelly, bassist Wilbur Ware, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. In addition to some group originals, obscurities, and the standard &quot;There Will Never Be Another You,&quot; the group also plays the earliest recorded version of Benny Golson's &quot;Blues March,&quot; predating Art Blakey's famous recording.
