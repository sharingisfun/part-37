Included in this adventure are several signature Punisher situations: Frank mowin&amp;#039; down criminals, Frank mowin&amp;#039; down some more criminals, lotsa of angst &amp; rage, Vietnam flashbacks, and the final one-on-one &quot;fight&quot; where our fave homicidal maniac goes by his own rules and does the unexpected to attain dark victory. Underrated penciler/ co-colorist Mike Zeck&amp;#039;s art (with finishing touches by inker John Beatty and wonderful pre-PhotoShop-era coloration) is top-notch. \n\nClassic Punisher..\n\n&quot;Return To Big Nothing&quot; reminded me of why I liked the character in the first place, and made me wonder why fans of Garth Ennis&amp;#039; work haven&amp;#039;t revisited it. Grant seems to share the same view of the Punisher as functional sociopath, though his slightly shady moral code is more palatable than most. Knowing full well the limitations of Frank&amp;#039;s personality, Grant focuses on the little details and clever bits that make or break a Punisher tale. Things like showing a 19-year-old punk Frank Castle getting his ass handled, or describing the smell of a Nevada whorehouse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d84c3afb18b1a43ea6fcf18a1e3154e8b071e9c","amp;dn":"Punisher..Return+to+big+Nothing..1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d84c3afb18b1a43ea6fcf18a1e3154e8b071e9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,132,195,175,177,139,26,67,234,111,207,24,161,227,21,78,139,7,30,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
