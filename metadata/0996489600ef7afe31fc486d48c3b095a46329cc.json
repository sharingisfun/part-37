Ewart Oakeshott outlines the significance and diversity of these ancient heirlooms; co-author Ian Peirce, who handled hundreds of swords in his research for this book in museums across northern Europe, selects and describes sixty of the finest representative weapons. Where possible, full-length photographs are included, in addition to illustrations of detail; an illustrated overview of blade types and construction, pattern-welding, inscription and handle forms and their classification prefaces the catalogue of examples which is the principal part of this work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0996489600ef7afe31fc486d48c3b095a46329cc","amp;dn":"Swords+Of+The+Viking+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0996489600ef7afe31fc486d48c3b095a46329cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,150,72,150,0,239,122,254,49,252,72,109,72,195,176,149,164,99,41,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
