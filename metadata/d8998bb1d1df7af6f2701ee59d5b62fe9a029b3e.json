Then re-encodes of BluRay and 720p Specials from Season 4 and 5 (episodes tagged as E00 and 13.5.\n\nSchedule:\nTuesday: 24, H.I.M.Y., Chuck, TBBT as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute\nWednesday: NCIS (both) as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute\nThursday: Crim. M as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute\nFriday:  Supernatural, Fringe as MP4 H264; ~3.30 MB/minute \nSaturday:  Smallville, Caprica as MP4 H264; ~3.30 MB/minute, Dollhouse as MP4 H264 360p\nSunday:  Legend o.t.S. as MP4 H264; ~3.30 MB/minute, re-seed of week's episodes\nMonday:  Desp.H, Being Human as MP4 H264; ~3.30 MB/minute\nDouble-episodes, requests or Pilot ep. will be issued only as MP4 or 360p.\nMP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video &amp; AAC LC sound) and playable on PCs, Macs and hopefully (read Comment before download; I check every file for iTunes compliance) on iPod-like portable-mobile devices.Due to small frame-size recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768.\n360p is fully compatible with newer iPod, iTouch and Nokia U97. \nRequests should be posted in Comments section of newest torrents.\n&quot;Out of schedule&quot; shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if situation arise (free slots).\n\nI recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nWARNING: \n\nIf you limit your upload speed during the download in initial seeding phase (when I am single seeder) FOR WHATEVER REASON, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be kicked-out for good. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to be later, I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t care less, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s up to your consciousness in relation to other people. Any ratio below 1.084 for sure means death of P2P, torrents and whole idea of sharing.\n\nI am sick and tired not only of Hit&amp;Run, but of 90% who think IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m some kind of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfree launchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ downloading service. NO ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ITÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S ABOUT SHARING. If you do not want or can or care to share, please, go someplace else. Consider this as one friendly warning. \n\nIMPORTANT: Torrents, especially of UK shows, are under constant and coordinated attack from British-based IP numbers. If you see number of peers with very, very similar address block them all (block range) with your firewall.\nTheir MO is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbyte-thrashersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; they aggressively pull bytes from normal peers, causing other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnormalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ peers to tag you as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuncooperativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ since all newer torrent programs have built-in Friend or Foe mechanism. \nNormal clients receive nothing from you (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“cause you gave packets to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgremlinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give you back any byte ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ simple as that. \nCompanies currently pay agencies and individuals to starve us to death (byte-wise and otherwise). Do not let them to get richer, and let us just to wave to their Jags, Porschs and yachts.\n\nPLUS: Chuck.Season.1.DVD.Bloopers.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].mp4 thanks to sanyam for sending me a link to input.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8998bb1d1df7af6f2701ee59d5b62fe9a029b3e","amp;dn":"Chuck.S03E06.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8998bb1d1df7af6f2701ee59d5b62fe9a029b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,153,139,177,209,223,122,246,242,112,30,229,157,91,98,254,154,2,155,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
