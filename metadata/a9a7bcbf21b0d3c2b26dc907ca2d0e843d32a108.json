In Food Microbiology Protocols, expert laboratorians present a wide ranging set of detailed techniques for investigating the nature, products, and extent of these important microorganisms. The methods cover pathogenic organisms that cause spoilage, microorganisms in fermented foods, and microorganisms producing metabolites that affect the flavor or nutritive value of foods. Included in the section dealing with fermented foods are procedures for the maintenance of lactic acid bacteria, the isolation of plasmid and genomic DNA from species Lactobacillus, and the determination of proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria. A substantial number of chapters are devoted to yeasts, their use in food and beverage production, and techniques for improving industrially important strains. There are also techniques for the conventional and molecular identification of spoilage organisms and pathogens, particularly bacteria, yeasts, and the molds that cause the degradation of poultry products. Each method is described step-by-step for assured results, and includes tips on avoiding pitfalls or developing extensions for new systems.. \r\nComprehensive and timely, Food Microbiology Protocols is a gold-standard collection of readily reproducible techniques essential for the study of the wide variety of microorganisms involved in food production, quality, storage, and preservation today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9a7bcbf21b0d3c2b26dc907ca2d0e843d32a108","amp;dn":"Methods+in+Biotechnology+14+-+Food+Microbiology+Protocols","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9a7bcbf21b0d3c2b26dc907ca2d0e843d32a108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,167,188,191,33,176,211,194,178,109,201,7,202,45,14,132,61,50,161,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
