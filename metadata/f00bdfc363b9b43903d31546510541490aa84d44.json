A tiny little island off the east coast of America sit on a fault in the underlying tectonic plate. On a night beset by a fierce storm and an earthquake simultaneously, the fault line cracks, releasing something foul from the Earth's guts, blown across the little coastal town of Smoky Island. The only two people on the island who were outside the reach of the black gas are now trapped on a spit of rock with a population that aren't what we'd call &quot;people&quot; anymore. After all, they started eating each other an hour ago... and it's about to get worse.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f00bdfc363b9b43903d31546510541490aa84d44","amp;dn":"Warren+Ellis+Blackgas+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f00bdfc363b9b43903d31546510541490aa84d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,11,223,195,99,185,180,57,3,211,21,70,81,5,65,73,10,168,77,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
