Once you get used to producer-director Jacques Perrin's French accent on the commentary track, you'll hear how he was afraid he'd have to remove the scene in which the World Trade Center is visible, how he doesn't consider the film a documentary as much as &quot;a homage to these beautiful birds,&quot; and how there was a happy ending to the film's most disturbing scene. Because the DVD's sound and picture are excellent, the film can serve as a Baraka-like ambient experience if desired\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/1017/wingedmigrationscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/1017/wingedmigrationscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4990/wingedmigrationscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4990/wingedmigrationscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3138/wingedmigrationscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3138/wingedmigrationscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2884/wingedmigrationscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2884/wingedmigrationscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6523/wingedmigrationscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6523/wingedmigrationscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/859/wingedmigrationscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/859/wingedmigrationscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img535.imageshack.us/img535/2019/wingedmigrationscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img535.imageshack.us/img535/2019/wingedmigrationscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9951/wingedmigrationscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9951/wingedmigrationscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/8990/wingedmigrationscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/8990/wingedmigrationscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Technical Specs for The Making of\n \n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1857 kbps\n \n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 52.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 2\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n \n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sonyclassics.com/wingedmigration/home.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sonyclassics.com/wingedmigration/home.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47be62d296d8855c8430c51b9a76e0572425a7c8","amp;dn":"Winged+Migration+2of2+The+Making+of+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47be62d296d8855c8430c51b9a76e0572425a7c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,190,98,210,150,216,133,92,132,48,197,27,154,118,224,87,36,37,167,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
