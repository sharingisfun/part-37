From the prequel novel, Revelation, to the series capstone, Deception, these original adventures weave together a science fiction epic as they follow Starship Alliance commander David Anderson and his young protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©e, scientist Kahlee Sanders, in their battle to save humanity. Packaged together for the first time, this exhilarating eBook bundle includes:\n \nREVELATION\nASCENSION\nRETRIBUTION\nDECEPTION\n \nSince discovering a cache of Prothean technology on Mars in 2148, humanity has spread to the stars. Now, on the edge of colonized space, ship commander and Alliance war hero David Anderson investigates the remains of a top secret military research station. Who attacked this post and for what purpose? And where is Kahlee Sanders, the young scientist who mysteriously vanished from the base hours before her colleagues were slaughtered? Sanders is now the prime suspect, but finding her creates more problems than it solves. Partnered with a rogue alien agent he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust and pursued by an assassin he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t escape, Anderson battles impossible odds on uncharted worlds to uncover a sinister conspiracyÃ¢â‚¬â€one he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live to tell about. Or so the enemy thinks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ba0f04e792acac1f63f20de07c9756d6f739e53","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect%3A+The+Complete+Novels+4-Book+Bundle+-+Revelation%2C+Asc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ba0f04e792acac1f63f20de07c9756d6f739e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,160,240,78,121,42,202,193,246,63,32,222,7,201,117,109,111,115,158,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
