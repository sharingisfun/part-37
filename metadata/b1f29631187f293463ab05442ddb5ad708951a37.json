The film is an adaptation of a novelette of the same title by Zhao Benfu that was first published in 1999. The original story is moderately different from the film adaptation. The film was first released in Shanghai, China on 5 December 2004. It clinched the 2005 Golden Horse Award for Best Screenplay Adaptation.\n\nThe plot is centered around a naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve village boy who does not believe in the existence of thieves. Returning home on board a train with his savings, he soon becomes the target of many thieves. The film explores the theme of the fundamental human goodness and also addresses humorously the issue of rampant thievery on public transport in Mainland China.\n\nRelease date: 5 December 2004 (People's Republic of China)\nRunning time: 113 min.\nLanguage: Mandarin Chinese\nSubtitles: English\n\nnfo included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1f29631187f293463ab05442ddb5ad708951a37","amp;dn":"A+World+Without+Thieves+%28Tian+xia+wu+zei%29+OV-STEn+-+WUNIK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1f29631187f293463ab05442ddb5ad708951a37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,242,150,49,24,127,41,52,99,171,5,68,45,219,90,215,8,149,26,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
