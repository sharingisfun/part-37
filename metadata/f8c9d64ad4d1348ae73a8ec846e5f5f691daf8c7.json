Building on the strengths of its IBMA Album of the Year predecessor, The Story Of The Day That I Died serves up another dozen classics and classics-in-the-making that prove the honors bestowed on The Heart Of A Song and its opening track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Far Cry From Lester And Earl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were no accidents. And though Junior and the guys have kept squarely in their winning groove, there are some new aspects to their music that promise to take the group even farther down the road to bluegrass immortality.\n\nTaking pride of place in the news about the latest release is the addition of Chris Davis to the quintet. For fans of soulful singing in the mountain style, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a welcome step, for Davis has earned a reputation as one of the musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful tenorsÃ¢â‚¬â€and most dynamic onstage personalitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€through his work with Larry Cordle &amp; Lonesome Standard Time and Marty Raybon. Indeed, from the moment he began making appearances with Ramblers Choice, DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal contributions helped to bring an already outstanding vocal combination to a new level and, like his young but veteran colleague in the band, Jason Tomlin, he takes on all three vocal roles hereÃ¢â‚¬â€lead, tenor and baritone. Add his assertive mandolin playing into the mix, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plain just how much Chris brings to the Ramblers Choice sound.\n\nIn a similar vein, Jason Davis has become a banjo player to watch, earning a growing reputation for his deepening mastery of every facet of the instrumentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic sounds. Though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deservedly front and center on a blistering version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jesse JamesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and puts the hammer down on the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up-tempo numbers, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s equally at home in the too-often neglected C tuning of more restrained numbers like the title track and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Prayers Go Up,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where he shows just how adeptly he can back a singer. Fiddler Billy Hawks, too, stands ready to tear it up when called upon to do so, but is equally at ease in playing a supporting role. Like their colleagues, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re musicians who understand that bluegrass is fundamentally an ensemble music, and bring all their talent to bear on serving each song.\n\nAnd what a strong set of songs appear on The Story Of The Day That I Died. A writer of no small ability himselfÃ¢â‚¬â€check out Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walking In Good Company,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ written with JuniorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite co-writer, his dadÃ¢â‚¬â€Sisk was clearly Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the zoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when it came time to choose material. Russell Johnson and Daniel Salyer, who contributed to The Heart Of A Song are back with distinctive new entries, as is Ashby Frank, whose sardonic Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Did The Leaving For YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the Junior Sisk &amp; Ramblers Choice debut is matched, if not excelled by the title track here. Long-time buddy and former neighbor Ronnie Bowman, who produced that debut, returns with a thoughtful contemporary number that stretches the group in a different direction.\n\nYet there are new names among the songwriters, too; Kentucky traditionalist David Carroll, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s written for IIIrd Tyme Out, Blue Moon Rising, the Lonesome River Band and more furnishes a lonesome waltz, while in a bold move that may surprise a few folks, Junior snatched up a modern piece of wisdom from Cadillac SkyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bryan Simpson before it disappeared into the studios of Music Row. And, on the other end of the spectrum, he revives an obscure Larry Sparks classic, and teams up with fellow traditionalistÃ¢â‚¬â€and fellow Rebel artistÃ¢â‚¬â€Joe Mullins for the inevitable Stanley Brothers number, Ã¢â‚¬Å“LoverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Quarrel.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAdd it all up, and The Story Of The Day That I Died is quintessential Junior Sisk &amp; Ramblers Choice. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little bit of just about everything to be found on this disc, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mostly bluegrass done just the way itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been done the bestÃ¢â‚¬â€with a whole lot of talent and a whole lot of soul!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8c9d64ad4d1348ae73a8ec846e5f5f691daf8c7","amp;dn":"Junior+Sisk+and+Ramblers+Choice+-+The+Story+of+the+Day+That+I+Di","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8c9d64ad4d1348ae73a8ec846e5f5f691daf8c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,201,214,74,212,209,52,138,231,58,142,200,70,229,245,246,145,218,248,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
