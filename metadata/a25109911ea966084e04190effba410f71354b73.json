Ever since the very beginning in the year 2000, the BS.PlayerÃ¢â€žÂ¢ has been one of the world's most popular multimedia players. It is popular for many reasons, one however should be pointed out: BS.PlayerÃ¢â€žÂ¢ is the first player ever to enable its users to focus on watching the movie instead of dealing with poor computer capabilities or running around looking for a proper setting and codec. BS.Player Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is used by more than 70 millions of multi media users throughout the world and it has been translated into more than 90 world languages.
