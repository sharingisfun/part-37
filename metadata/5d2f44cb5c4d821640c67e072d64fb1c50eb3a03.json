Working since 1997 with the intention to create an thrash metal band with classical roots, influenced mainly by European representative bands, mixing speed and hardness of the riffs of the 80s, but with splashes of what we did in the 90s.\n\nSAGROS Ideology is humanistic, focus on a single base that is the human being. Our lyrics talk about our view of man as creator and destroyer of all that is, their perception of life and death, its achievements and defeat, good and evil, their deepest fears and all the chaos, desolation and confusion that it may cause. Based on experiences of all kinds, build self-criticism or reflection on our very existence that can be, depending on the chosen path, pleasantly harmonious or tragically tormented one.\n\n\nAnger Blinds The Mind (2013)\n\n\nQuote:\nBlinding anger and familiar influences abound. - 80%\n\nFew would contest that death metal and thrash metal share a fairly close relationship, particularly during second half of the 80s when the former style was just beginning to develop into a distinct style from the latter. However, it is curious to note that almost 30 years later there still exists a fair level of ambiguity as to where one ends and the other begins, particularly amongst a crop of recent thrash metal acts that show a very obvious affinity for the likes of Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, and a number of other 80s thrash acts that are credited with setting the stage for said style's uglier cousin. Particularly curious is the long overdue debut album of a Colombian outfit Sagros in Anger Blinds The Mind, an LP that appears commonplace for today's retro-thrash scene at first, but proves to be fairly unique upon closer inspection.\n\nTo dispense with the obvious, the neck-ruination going on within this twisted exposition of South American styled humanism meshed with a subtler variant on political commentary than many in the style isn't too far off from the mid-80s Kreator mold heard out of the likes of Suicidal Angels and Drunkard of late, ergo lots of high speed fury and a steady onslaught of growled vocals that fall just a tiny bit short of morphing into Chuck Schuldiner grunts. However, musically there's a bit more going on here that further ventures into death metal territory, both instrumentally and vocally. Perhaps the most blatant of all is the cover of fellow Colombian and Hateworks label adherents Masacre's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wrath Intense PainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which is itself purely a death metal song by a death metal band. Similarly, the otherwise thrashing crusher Ã¢â‚¬Å“Falsa VictoriaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features some overt modern brutal vocalizations that have more in common with Pathology's own Matti Way than that of Mike Petrozza, not to mention a prominent blast beat section right out of the Repulsion playbook.\n\nThough the death metal tendencies are obvious, barring the two aforementioned songs, this album works more closely in the world of mid-80s high octane red thrash with a side-order of later 80s Bay Area detailing and nuance. While crippling in intensity, most of these songs take a bit more time to slow things down and pummel the listener with a decent mid-tempo groove for a spell or two, almost as if injecting a little bit of a South Of Heaven meets Arise character into what is otherwise a clear nod to Reign In Blood and Schizophrenia. An additional curve ball comes in with lead guitarist Luis Cuartas' solo breaks, which are a bit more reminiscent of the bluesy character of Chris Poland and Kirk Hammett rather than the chaotic noise of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, as can be clearly gleaned on the sorrowful instrumental semi-ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Agony InsideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, as well as more intense Slayer-infused cruisers like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Quietud MortalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nDespite being in a fairly crowded field of thrash revivalist acts that are more prone to remember the 80s than otherwise, there is a definite charm to this album that cuts through a good deal of the competition and offers up a solid, clear cut mixture of extreme aggression and musicianship. It's particularly geared towards anyone with an equal affinity for the dark origins of thrash metal's ugly cousin, laying somewhere between the nastiness of Persecution Mania and the morose horror of Beneath The Remains. Expectations of thrown-out necks should be met, along with a slightly higher caliber of lyrical content than the average poetic celebration of war and alcohol.\n\n1 - Anger Blinds the Mind (04:22)\n2 - Inhumanity (05:30)\n3 - Quietud Mortal (03:24)\n4 - For Your Blood (05:01)\n5 - Falsa Victoria (04:15)\n6 - Once Before I Die (05:38)\n7 - The Agony Inside(02:30)\n8 - Asesinos (05:09)\n9 - Wrath Intense Pain (Masacre cover) (04:02)\n\nEnjoy!\n\nGenre:\tThrash\nBitrate:\tVbr\nSize:\t77.22 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n10 files\nAdded:\t18/11/2014a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d2f44cb5c4d821640c67e072d64fb1c50eb3a03","amp;dn":"Sagros+-+Anger+Blinds+The+Mind+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d2f44cb5c4d821640c67e072d64fb1c50eb3a03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,47,68,203,92,77,130,22,64,198,126,7,45,100,251,28,80,235,58,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
