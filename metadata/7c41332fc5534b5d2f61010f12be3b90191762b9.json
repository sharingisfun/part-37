Also contains three video releases with extras from the Ch. 4 show plus even earlier Ali G stuff from the Eleven O'clock Show. \n\nAs far as I can tell none of these have been released in the United States. I have no idea why; this stuff is hilarious. Enjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c41332fc5534b5d2f61010f12be3b90191762b9","amp;dn":"Ali+G+-+Da+UK+Seereez+%2B+home+video+releases","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c41332fc5534b5d2f61010f12be3b90191762b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,65,51,47,197,83,75,93,47,97,1,15,18,190,59,144,25,23,98,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
