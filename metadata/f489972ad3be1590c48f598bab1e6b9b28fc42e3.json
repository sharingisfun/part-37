Timbaland had a huge part in producing, writing and remixing on this album (He even has his own song on here) giving this album a whole Timbaland flavor. The obvious highlight here is Aaliyah's Are You That Somebody? which is probably the only R&amp;B song to ever hit #1 on TRL. It is really catchy and has a great bass. Another highlight is All Saint's version of Lady Marmalade, remixed by Timbaland. While they don't really capture the flair of the original song, their voices sound very smooth and stylish, bringing a whole new personality to it. 69 Boyz's stadium smash Woof Woof is also included. Former En Vogue member Dawn Robinson does an interesting cover of Aretha Franklin's Rocksteady. Already big namers like Montell Jordan and Ginuwine also provide some quality tracks. If you like R&amp;B and are a fan of Timbaland's music, or music that sounds like his style, then pick this up for sure. It's a great collection of some killer songs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f489972ad3be1590c48f598bab1e6b9b28fc42e3","amp;dn":"Dr.+Dolittle+-+The+Album+-+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+320cbr+%28Big","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f489972ad3be1590c48f598bab1e6b9b28fc42e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,137,151,42,211,190,21,144,196,143,89,139,171,30,107,155,40,252,66,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
