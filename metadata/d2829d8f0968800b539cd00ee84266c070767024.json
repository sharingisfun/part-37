It is complex in both musical content and lyrical themes working together to reflect the overarching concept of the record as a whole. Concept records by nature are hard to create without deterring from the story or losing interest from the listeners, but Defeater rises to the occasion in order to deliver their best story yet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2829d8f0968800b539cd00ee84266c070767024","amp;dn":"DEFEATER+-+Abandoned+%28Deluxe%29+%282015%29+%5BMelodic+Hardcore%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2829d8f0968800b539cd00ee84266c070767024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,130,157,143,9,104,128,11,83,156,208,14,232,66,102,192,112,118,112,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
