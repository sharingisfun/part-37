Try the fries.]\nJohn Grisham is an American author, best known for his popular legal thrillers. Before becoming a writer, he was a successful lawyer and politician. As of 2008, his books have sold over a crap-ton of copies worldwide.\n\nTroy Phelan, an eccentric &amp; elderly billionaire, commits suicide minutes after leaving his vast fortune to an illegitimate daughter, Rachel Lane, instead of his six children by three marriages. His reason is revulsion to years of fighting with &amp; embarrassment from his family, as well as their greed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ much of which was due to his neglect of his children and multiple affairs (both personal and business). His lawyers are now tasked with protecting Troy's wishes as well as finding the heiress. Nate O'Riley, a recovering alcoholic, is sent to Brazil, where Rachel is living as a missionary.\n\n- - -\n\n  From BooksOnTape.com\n\nTroy Phelan is a self-made billionaire, one of the richest men in the United States. He is also eccentric, reclusive, confined to a wheelchair, and looking for a way to die. His heirs, to no one's surprise - especially Troy's - are circling like vultures. Nate O'Riley is a high-octane Washington litigator who's lived too hard, too fast, for too long. His second marriage is in a shambles, and he is emerging from his fourth stay in rehab armed with little more than his fragile sobriety, good intentions, and resilient sense of humor. Returning to the real world is always difficult, but this time it's going to be murder. Rachel Lane is a young woman who chose to give her life to God, who walked away from the modern world with all its strivings and trappings and encumbrances, and went to live and work with a primitive tribe of Indians in the deepest jungles of Brazil. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac867230303f990dab7e833241afc190744c4834","amp;dn":"THE+TESTAMENT+-+John+Grisham.+Read+by+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac867230303f990dab7e833241afc190744c4834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,134,114,48,48,63,153,13,171,126,131,50,65,175,193,144,116,76,72,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
