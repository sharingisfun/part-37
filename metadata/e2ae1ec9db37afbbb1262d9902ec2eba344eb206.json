The setting is Words, Wisconsin, an anonymous town of only a few hundred people. But under its sleepy surface, life rages. Cora and Graham guard their dairy farm, and family, from the wicked schemes of their milk co-op. Lifelong paraplegic Olivia suddenly starts to walk, only to find herself crippled by her fury toward her sister and caretaker, Violet. Recently retired Rusty finds a cougar living in his haymow, dredging up haunting childhood memories. Winifred becomes pastor of the Friends church and stumbles on enlightenment in a very unlikely place. And Julia Montgomery, both private and gregarious, instigates a series of events that threatens the town's solitude and doggedly suspicious ways. Driftless finds the author's powers undiminished in this unforgettable story that evokes a small-town America previously unmapped, and the damaged denizens who must make their way through it\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3154783-driftless&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3154783-driftless&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2ae1ec9db37afbbb1262d9902ec2eba344eb206","amp;dn":"Driftless+by+David+Rhodes+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2ae1ec9db37afbbb1262d9902ec2eba344eb206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,174,30,201,219,55,175,187,177,38,45,153,2,236,46,186,52,78,178,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
