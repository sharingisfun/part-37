Narrated by TRUMAN CAPOTE. In color. Emmy Award winning adaptation of Capote&amp;#039;s recollection of his youth in the rural South during the Depression. Living with a slightly dotty but loving &quot;cousin,&quot; Capote remembers back to when he was about 10 years old and it was suddenly decided that &quot;it was fruitcake weather.&quot; The task of baking 30 cakes for mostly far-away friends and the other rituals of Christmas time are painted with such loving and nostalgic strokes, this becomes a truly beautiful Christmas experience. The poverty of the 1930s fails to stop or even slow down a loving relationship at a loving time of the year. An Emmy Award well deserved!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c2f3b40362115e4a344804826a264e4829170d","amp;dn":"Truman+Capote%5C%27s+A+Christmas+Memory+%28In+Color%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c2f3b40362115e4a344804826a264e4829170d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,194,243,180,3,98,17,94,74,52,72,4,130,106,38,78,72,41,23,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
