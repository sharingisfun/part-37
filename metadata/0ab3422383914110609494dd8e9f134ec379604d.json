Got your FPL card?\n_____________________________________________________\n\nLetting Go is Philip Roth's first full-length novel, published just after Goodbye,\n Columbus, when he was twenty-nine. Set in 1950s Chicago, New York, and Iowa City, \nLetting Go presents as brilliant a fictional portrait as we have of a mid-century \nAmerica defined by social and ethical constraints and by moral compulsions \nconspicuously different from those of today. Newly discharged from the Korean War \narmy, reeling from his mother's recent death, freed from old attachments and \nhungrily seeking others, Gabe Wallach is drawn to Paul Herz, a fellow graduate \nstudent in literature, and to Libby, Paul's moody, intense wife. Gabe's desire to \nbe connected to the ordered &quot;world of feeling&quot; that he finds in books is first \ntested vicariously by the anarchy of the HerzesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ struggles with responsible \nadulthood and then by his own eager love affairs. Driven by the desire to live \nseriously and act generously, Gabe meets an impassable test in the person of \nMartha Reganhart, a spirited, outspoken, divorced mother of two, a formidable \nwoman who, according to critic James Atlas, is masterfully portrayed with &quot;depth \nand resonance.&quot; The complex liaison between Gabe and Martha and Gabe's moral \nenthusiasm for the trials of others are at the heart of this ambitious first \nnovel. &quot;[Roth] has the finest eye for the details of American life since Sinclair \nLewis.&quot;\n\n* National Book Award, Fiction, 1960\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When she Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My life as a man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ab3422383914110609494dd8e9f134ec379604d","amp;dn":"LETTING+GO+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+Luke+Daniels+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ab3422383914110609494dd8e9f134ec379604d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,179,66,35,131,145,65,16,96,148,148,221,142,159,19,78,195,121,96,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
