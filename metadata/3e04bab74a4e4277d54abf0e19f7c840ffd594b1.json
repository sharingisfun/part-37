The game combines point &amp; click gameplay with unique magic skills. Sadja, a Southern princess, has an unstoppable desire to become the greatest hero in history Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by joining and succeeding in the biggest war Aventuria has ever seen: The war of the Mages, fought in the middle of an uninhabitable desert.\n\nBird catcher Geron lives almost 450 years after the Great War. GeronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eternal love, Nuri, has been turned into a crow by an evil curse. To give her back her human form, Geron needs the help of the mysterious merchant Fahi, who has magical powers. But Fahi is only willing to help Geron if he agrees to solve a puzzle which Fahi has seen in his dreams. The quest for answers soon leads to a chain of events that connects both Sadja's and Geron's stories, threatening to turn the present into a grim reflection of a long forgotten past.\n\nMemoria combines classic point &amp; click adventure gameplay with the features of The Dark Eye, one of the most successful RPG universes known in the fantasy world. Point &amp; click adventure game puzzles get a unique twist by adding magical features Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a wise, talking staff. Over eight chapters, players control both SadjaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and GeronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fates, involuntarily interacting with each other and bridging over 500 years of time. Each chapter in Memoria features opulent graphics, epic locations, a thrilling fantasy crime story and a unique puzzle design that differs from chapter to chapter.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/d3590b74d9849f731a035ae5645cf98dd39d6a60.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/d3590b74d9849f731a035ae5645cf98dd39d6a60.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstall and Play.\n\nOther:\nGenre:........................................adventure / point-and-click / fantasy\nDownload size:...........................8 GB\nRelease date:.............................August 30, 2013\nCompatible with:........................Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8)\nLanguages:................................English\nDeveloper / Publisher:................Daedalic Entertainment\nGame modes:.............................single-player\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/81de0a43434071421e99236dbf3baf417d2d9444.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/81de0a43434071421e99236dbf3baf417d2d9444.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBonus content included:\n48 artworks\n8 avatars\n6 wallpapers\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/3dfac1633b2ab5083c23736de24ba5737ce578a1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/3dfac1633b2ab5083c23736de24ba5737ce578a1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSystem Requirements:\nMinimum system requirements:Windows VistaÃ¢â€žÂ¢/7Ã¢â€žÂ¢/8Ã¢â€žÂ¢, 2.5 GHz single-core-processor or 2 GHz dual-core-processor, 2.5 GB memory, OpenGL2.0-compatible graphics card with 512 MB RAM, DirectXÃ‚Â®9.0c-compatible sound card, 10 GB HD space, Mouse (third mouse button and scroll reel recommended).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/8e43bf6301c4a7330297e438f59e2edb22dac4a5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/8e43bf6301c4a7330297e438f59e2edb22dac4a5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like the game and wish to support the developers click on the link below\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/memoria&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/memoria&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e04bab74a4e4277d54abf0e19f7c840ffd594b1","amp;dn":"Memoria+%5BAugust+30%2C+2013%5D%5BVersion+2.0.0.3%5D%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e04bab74a4e4277d54abf0e19f7c840ffd594b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,4,186,183,74,78,66,119,213,74,191,14,25,247,200,64,255,213,148,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
