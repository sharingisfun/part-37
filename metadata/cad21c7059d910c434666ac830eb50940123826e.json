Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n40_14 r1\n** updated Dwarf Fortress to version 40.14\n - updated all graphics (via Fricy's collection)\n - updated PyLNP to v0.7.1\n - removed old windows-only launcher\n - updated Dwarf Therapist to v28.0.0\n - updated all keybindings for 40.14\n - updated DFHack to 40.14-r1\n - updated TwbT to v5.29\n - fixed misc. configuration issues\n\nMD5 CHECKSUM: A948D8834D5F43F9EA7C13B18B749B39","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad21c7059d910c434666ac830eb50940123826e","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_14+Starter+Pack+r1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad21c7059d910c434666ac830eb50940123826e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,210,28,112,89,217,16,196,52,102,106,200,48,235,80,148,1,35,130,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
