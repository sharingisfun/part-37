In its favor, it does include nine tracks from her 1963-1964 girl group-influenced singles, whereas the most commonly available Davis anthology (Tell Him: The Decca Years has just four of those. In all, it has ten songs not on Tell Him: The Decca Years, but is also missing three songs that are not that release, whose sound quality is better (though not seriously flawed). And the liner notes on Her Best: 1963-1970 are perfunctory, though it does contain a complete 1962-1970 Davis discography. So what most people would pick this up for are the ten songs not on Tell Him, which are useful for Davis fans, but not (with one exception) among her most outstanding recordings. That one exception is the moody, sassy 1964 single &quot;Whatcha' Gonna Do,&quot; perhaps her best girl group-styled effort; the Mersey-influenced chirpy warble of its B-side &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; is pretty enjoyable too. However, the other tracks not found on Tell Him are either fairly undistinguished 1963-1964 sides, or competent but unremarkable covers (including the Turtles' &quot;Me About You,&quot; Buffy Sainte-Marie's &quot;Until It's Time for You to Go,&quot; the Moody Blues' &quot;Nights in White Satin,&quot; and Nilsson's &quot;Without Him&quot;) from her 1967-1970 recordings. The rare 1970 Spanish-language single &quot;Venid con Mego&quot; is also here, though it too is only a fair pop-soul production. Tell Him: The Decca Years still gets the nod for the best Billie Davis comp, but this lengthier anthology still does a good job of presenting highlights of the career from this decent if second-division British singer, from both her perky 1963-1964 output and her more mature, soul-influenced 1967-1970 work. Neither this nor Tell Him, incidentally, include anything from her seven 1965-1966 Piccadilly singles, three of which she did as half of the duo Keith &amp; Billie. While there might be a limited demand for such a thing, someone should do a two-disc set that finally assembles all of the sides she cut for Decca, Columbia, and Piccadilly into one place.\nAll Music Review by Richie Unterberger\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] I Want You To Be My Baby (Hendricks) (196\n[02] Me About You (Bonner-Gordon) (1970)\n[03] Until It's Time For You To Go (St.Marie) (1967)\n[04] Love To Love (Diamond) (1970)\n[05] Without Him (Nilsson) (1970)\n[06] Nights In White Satin (Hayward) (1969)\n[07] Tell Him (Russell) (1963)\n[08] Billy Sunshine (Chip Taylor-Al Gordoni) (1970)\n[09] Living In The Past (Anderson) (1970)\n[10] Angel Of The Morning (Chip Taylor-Al Gordoni) (1967)\n[11] Make The Feeling Go Away (Poor) (1969)\n[12] It's Over (Rodgers) (1969)\n[13] I'm In Love With You (Levine-Resnick) (1970)\n[14] Wasn't It You (Goffin-King) (1967)\n[15] I'm Thankful (Blackwell) (1963)\n[16] He's The One (Blackwell) (1963)\n[17] That Boy John (Barry-Greenwich) (1964)\n[18] V.I.P.
