I beleive it is originally from a radio broadcast but then received an official release thru Zoom Club. It kicks off with the excellent We Belong to the Night which is as good a starter as Natural Thing was. There is a nice mix of classic songs and newer ones (for the time) and it is a great companion to the Strangers in the Night set. Nice to see Tonka getting some live action on disc. Cool sleeve too!
