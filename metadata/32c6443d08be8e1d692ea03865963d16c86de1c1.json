The rhythm section\nhere consists of Joe Morris on bass and Whit Dickey on drums, and Daniel Carter\nplays trumpet and sax, four musicians who've played numerous times together and\nreleased regular albums over the past twenty years.\n\nThe album brings a suite in 9 parts, starting with an interesting and\ndisturbing piece, that sets the tone for the rest of the record. Carter's\ntrumpet is meditative, and Shipp seems to joins for slow jazzy accompaniment,\nweaving beautiful harmonics, but only briefly, shifting tone and tempo\nabruptly, moving into more avant-garde territory, followed by bass and\ndrums. And as Carter moves to tenor, this does not seem to perturb his\nmeditative feel, despite the nervousness playing of the three other\nmusicians. The second part is really calm, without any apparent theme or\nmelody, yet it is structured, with lots of silence and openness, Carter's on\nbass clarinet, still keeping his cool tone, with Morris on arco, and Shipp and\nDickey accentuating the barely audible fragile playing by Carter. This\nseamlessly moves into the third piece, still calm, but dark and intense, with\nthe piano taking a break. The fourth track increases the tempo and back into\nbop harmonics and rhythms, with Shipp setting the scene and driving the music\nforward, just to retreat again and leave the floor to the three others, only to\njoin again for the closing chords. Part six is a piano trio, with very abstract\nimprovisation by Shipp, with lots of variation in mood and rhythm, slowing down\nfor a solo piano piece on the seventh track. After a more intense and\npropulsive, thundering piece, the last track goes back to the open-ended avant\nmode of the third part of the suite, but now with the piano joining. It is the\nmost sensitive and most beautiful piece, and that says a lot, because every\ntrack on this album is stunning. Lots of variation, sensitive and creative\nplaying, innovative and familiar. Without a doubt one of Matthew Shipp's best\nrecords in years. Highly recommended.\n\n--\n\nBy John Sharpe &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/...ds-review-by-john-sharpe.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/...ds-review-by-john-sharpe.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Glenn Astarita &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jazzreview.com/cd...y-matthew-shipp-quartet.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jazzreview.com/cd...y-matthew-shipp-quartet.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32c6443d08be8e1d692ea03865963d16c86de1c1","amp;dn":"Matthew+Shipp+Quartet+-+Cosmic+Suite+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32c6443d08be8e1d692ea03865963d16c86de1c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,198,68,61,8,190,142,29,105,46,160,56,101,150,61,22,200,109,225,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
