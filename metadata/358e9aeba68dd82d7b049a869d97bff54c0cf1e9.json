It enables you to create, organize and manage archives in a comfortable and quick manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRich feature lineup\r\n\r\nThe complexcompression algorithm it uses creates small archives, saving disk space and enabling faster file sharing. Audio and graphics files benifit from a special archiving algorithm, one that doesn't make a compromise on quality. It includes Windows Explorer shortcuts for easy access and supports drag and drop as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinRAR also provides possibilities to split archives into several volumes; this way, a large archive such as a film, is divided into smaller ones, which makes the perfect way to share huge files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvanced security and ease of use\r\n\r\nIn case you wish to secure your files, you can always protect your data with a password, while the &quot;Repair&quot; function comes in handy whenever you try to fix a broken archive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the fact that it does a great job whet it comes to compressing files, WinRAR also integrades dedicated features that allow you to manipulate archives with a sinfgle click.

It allows you to handle the most popular compression formats using a single interface and at very high speeds provided by the complex engine hidden under the hood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinRAR undoubtedly comes with one iof the most advanced feature sets currently on the market and even though it's not offered for free, it remains one of the leading compression tools that you can install om Windows these days","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:358e9aeba68dd82d7b049a869d97bff54c0cf1e9","amp;dn":"WinRAR+5.31+Final+%2B+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"358e9aeba68dd82d7b049a869d97bff54c0cf1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,142,154,235,166,141,216,45,123,4,154,134,157,151,191,245,76,12,241,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
