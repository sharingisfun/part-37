K. Rowling. The series, named after the titular character, chronicle the adventures of a wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's quest to overcome the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who aims to become immortal, conquer the wizarding world, subjugate non-magical people, and destroy all those who stand in his way, especially Harry Potter.\n\nSince the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 30 June 1997, the books have gained immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide.[2] The series has also had some share of criticism, including concern for the increasingly dark tone. As of June 2011, the book series has sold about 450 million copies, making it the best-selling book series in history, and has been translated into 67 languages.[3][4] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history.\n\nNOTE: Just like my release of 'The Lord of the Rings Collection', included\n      in this torrent are: 1) the Movie, 2) the Audio Book and finally 3) the eBook\n      in PDF format. Both the audio book as well as the eBook are unabridged. The\n      Synopsis below is a description of the 8 movies. However, the books tend to\n      follow the same general story arc. This is why I do not include a synopsis\n      for the books.\n\nTotal Movies:      8\nTotal Audio Books: 7\nTotal eBooks:      7\n\n\nMovie Descriptions:\n\n\n01 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - (2001)\n\n     Movie Synopsis: Harry Potter is an orphaned boy brought up by his unfriendly\n                     aunt and uncle.

Harry became\n                     extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. Harry\n                     begins his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\n                     Wizardry and learns about magic. During the year, Harry and\n                     his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled\n                     in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone which is being kept\n                     within the school.\n\n\n02 - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - (2002)\n\n     Movie Synopsis: Harry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their second\n                     year, which proves to be more challenging than the last.

Three European schools participate in the\n                     tournament, with three 'champions' representing each school in\n                     the deadly tasks.
