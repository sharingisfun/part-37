Vilenkin.\n\nIn the present book, the aim has been to set forth a variety of\ncombinatorial problems in popular form and understandable language.\nAt the same time, an attempt is made to present some rather involved\ncombinatorial problems and to give the reader an idea of the methods\nof recurrence relations and generating functions.  The first chapter\nis devoted to the general rules of combinatorics, the rules of sum and\nproduct. In the second chapter we investigate permutations and\ncombinations. This traditionally grade-school material is accompanied\nby an analysis of some amusing examples. In the third chapter, a study\nis made of combinatorial problems in which certain restrictions are\nimposed on the combinations. Chapter IV considers problems involving\npartitions of numbers into integers and- contains a description of\ncertain geometrical methods in combinatorics. Chapter V is devoted to\nrandom-walk problems and to a variety of modifica tions of the\narithmetic triangle. Chapter VI takes up recurrence relations, and\nChapter VII discusses generating functions and, in particular, the\nbinomial formula.\n\nThe last section of the book is devoted to combinatorial problems of\nwhich there are over 400.  This material has been taken from a variety\nof sources, including Whitworth's Choice and Chance (London, 1901),\nJohn Riordan's An Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis (New York,\n1958), an interesting book by A. M. Yaglom and I. M. Yaglom entitled\nNonelementary Problems in an Elementary Exposition (Moscow, 1954), and\nvarious collections of problems given at mathematical olympiads in\nthe USSR.\n\n This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky. The\n  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1972.\n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  DJVU | 3.8 MB | Pages: 205 | OCR \n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface \n\nCHAPTER I.
