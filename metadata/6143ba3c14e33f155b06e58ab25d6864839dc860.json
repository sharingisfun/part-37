Will and the three Drew kids are brought to Cornwall, where the grail has been stolen. Jane is haunted by nightmares about the Greenwitch, a symbolic weaving of branches and leaves cast into the sea, and a sinister artist captures Barney. But the Greenwitch is not just a tangle of sticks -- it's alive with wild magic that neither Old Ones nor the Dark can control.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6143ba3c14e33f155b06e58ab25d6864839dc860","amp;dn":"Greenwitch+-+Susan+Cooper++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6143ba3c14e33f155b06e58ab25d6864839dc860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,67,186,60,20,227,63,21,91,6,229,138,178,93,104,100,131,157,200,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
