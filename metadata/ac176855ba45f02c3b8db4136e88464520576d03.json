They can be used in Cubase, Audition, Sonar, Live, and any other prog that will support these files. The files within are all .ogg files, and are easy to work with. \n\nThese are a little lossy, they do fairly ok though. The entire album is in here. This is also the only known rip of these files, and is currently very hard to find. This should change this... :)\n\nPlease share these files as much as you can, the goal is that these spread like wildfire so that people are able to make their own interpretation of this great record. Upload to other file sharing sites, torrent sites, burn to disk and post to your mates, whatever!! Just get this shit out there!!! The quicker we do this, the more closer we are to a solution for this abomination that is the Loudness War!!!\n\nCrate a dance remix, remaster the album, whatever you want, then upload to absolutely everywhere known to human kind!!! Lets show Q-Prime and Warner that we fucking mean business!!! Lets get this shit happening!!!\n\nIf you enjoy these files, please show your support for a Death Magnetic Creative Commons at the following link. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ipetitions.com/petition/deathmagneticsolution/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ipetitions.com/petition/deathmagneticsolution/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nThis is the only way to end the war of words between fans, the band, and their management. This issue needs to be adressed. This is the only viable way to do this. Metal is meant to be played loud. Not fucking brickwalled to the point of stupidity!!!\n\nEACH OTHER TORRENT SITE THIS IS UPLOADED TO MEANS THAT WE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE!! LET EVERYONE KNOW ABOUT THESE FILES!!! AND SIGN THE PETITION!!! \n\n\nnow also available from\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac176855ba45f02c3b8db4136e88464520576d03","amp;dn":"Metallica+Death+Magnetic+Stems+Seperated+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac176855ba45f02c3b8db4136e88464520576d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,23,104,85,186,69,240,44,59,141,180,19,110,136,70,69,32,87,109,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
