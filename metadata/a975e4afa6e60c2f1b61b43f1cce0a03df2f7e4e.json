It is updated to version 34 (the newest, as of August, 2014). It is fully patched for play through Tunngle but will also work off-line. Make sure to run the installer with administrative privileges.\n\nBEFORE you play for the first time:\n\nIf you wish to change your name, look in your installation folder for a file called &quot;SmartSteamEmu.ini&quot;. Scroll down until you find &quot;PersonaName&quot;. Change to your hearts content and play the game. If you launch the game without changing your name, you will have no choice but to delete your profile and start again!\n\nWhenever you launch the game, select &quot;LAN / Offline&quot; (online will NOT work). You will still see servers on Crime.net if connected properly to Tunngle.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nNow go rob some banks and steal some jewelry!\n\n- AmULet of ThePirateBay\n\n\nEXTRAS INCLUDED: Soundtracks (Regular + Christmas), The Guide of Bain\n\nCurrent Version: 1.12.8 (Update 3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a975e4afa6e60c2f1b61b43f1cce0a03df2f7e4e","amp;dn":"PAYDAY.2.v1.12.8.Plus.DLCs-AmULet+%28August+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a975e4afa6e60c2f1b61b43f1cce0a03df2f7e4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,117,228,175,166,230,12,47,27,97,180,63,28,206,10,3,223,47,126,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
