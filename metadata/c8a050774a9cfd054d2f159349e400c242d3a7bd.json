Downloaded on 1/16/15\n\nMoonscape is a free and freely shareable high-definition documentary about the first manned Moon landing. Funded and produced by space enthusiasts from all over the world, it shows the full Apollo 11 landing and moonwalk, using only the original audio, TV and film footage and the original photographs, rescanned and restored from the best available sources, with full English subtitles (other languages will follow). \n\nAll this material has been scanned, digitized and restored from the best available sources. The live TV broadcast, the 16mm color film footage shot on the Moon and in Mission Control, and the Hasselblad 70mm color photographs taken by astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, have been fully synchronized with the audio recordings (including the onboard and Mission Control recordings) and are presented in real time, as they happened, with full subtitles in English or Italian. \n\nMoonscape is made possible by the donations and hard work of many people. If you like what you see and you want to help the project (and have your name or company name in the end credits as a sponsor), please make a donation so we can continue improving Moonscape by purchasing additional remastered HD transfers of the original Apollo mission footage, hiring a professional voice-over actor for the commentary, and adding more features (such as additional photos, Mission Control footage, animations and maps).\n\nA free documentary produced and funded by Apollo enthusiasts,\nfeaturing restored and remastered footage and photographs\n\nYou can download all of Moonscape, with English or Italian subtitles, by clicking this link, which takes you to my Google Drive.
