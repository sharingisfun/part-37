He hasn't aged. Much of Earth is laid in ruins, Nerv has been dismantled, and people who he once protected have turned against him. Befriending the enigmatic Nagisa Kowaru, Shinji continues the fight against the angels and realizes the fighting is far from over, even when it could be against his former allies. The characters' struggles continue amidst the battles against the angels and each other, spiraling down to what could inevitably be the end of the world.\n\n\nGenres: drama, science fiction\n\n\nThemes: mecha, post-apocalyptic, real robot\n\n\nType: Movie\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language : English\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b514543b225522184bd65e5ff889ba491b63c15","amp;dn":"%5BUTW-THORA%5D+Evangelion+3.33+You+Can+%28Not%29+Redo+%5BXviD+AnimeSenshi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b514543b225522184bd65e5ff889ba491b63c15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,81,69,67,178,37,82,33,132,189,101,229,255,136,155,164,145,182,60,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
