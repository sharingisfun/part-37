Formed in 1983 following Mustaine's departure from Metallica, the band has since released eleven studio albums, six live albums, two EPs, thirty singles, thirty-two music videos, and three compilations.\n\nAs a pioneer of the American thrash metal movement, Megadeth rose to international fame in the 1980s, but experienced numerous lineup changes, due partly to the band's notorious substance abuse problems. After finding sobriety and securing a stable lineup, Megadeth went on to release a string of platinum and gold albums, including the platinum-selling thrash metal landmark Rust in Peace in 1990 and the Grammy nominated, multi-platinum Countdown to Extinction in 1992. Megadeth disbanded in 2002 after Mustaine suffered a severe nerve injury to his left arm, but following extensive physical therapy, Mustaine reformed the band in 2004 and released The System Has Failed, followed by United Abominations in 2007; the albums debuted on the Billboard Top 200 chart at #18 and #8, respectively.\n\nMegadeth is known for a distinctive guitar style, often involving complex, intricate musical passages, and trade off guitar solos. Mustaine is also known for his original &quot;snarling&quot; vocal style, as well as his recurring lyrical themes, often involving politics, war, addiction, and personal relationships.\n\nAs one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands of all time, Megadeth has sold more.....http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/Megadeth/\n\nAlbum List:\n[01] (0000) Ultimate Rare Tracks, But Who's Listening (Bootleg)\n[02] (1984) Last Rites (Demo)\n[03] (1984) Live in San Francisco - February 19, 1984 (Bootleg)\n[04] (1985) Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!

Yes I have personally ripped most of these. The rare tracks &amp; bootlegs are not my own rips. I have only included one scene release &quot;Anthology - Set the World Afire is a VAG release I have left in the original nfo for that but the rest are not scene so there really is no one to give credit where credit is due. Anyway enjoy this release.\n\nSome Helpful links::\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=138\nhttp://www.megadeth.com/\nhttp://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/Megadeth/\n\nQuality is listed in nfo.
