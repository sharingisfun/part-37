This concise and modern book provides a complete overview of both solvent extraction separation techniques and the novel and unified competitive complexation/solvation theory. This novel and unified technique presented in the book provides a key for a preliminary quantitative prediction of suitable extraction systems without experimentation, thus saving researchers time and resources.\n\n    Analyzes and compares both classical and new competitive models and techniques\n    Offers a novel and unified competitive complexation / solvation theory that permits researchers to standardize some parameters, which decreases the need for experimentation at R&amp;D\n    Presents examples of applications in multiple disciplines such as chemical, biochemical, radiochemical, pharmaceutical and analytical separation\n    Written by an outstanding scientist who is prolific in the field of separation science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5ba4822ab8d8e9fdf4e6336d0b53a25836681ea","amp;dn":"Solvent+Extraction%3A+Classical+and+Novel+Approaches+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5ba4822ab8d8e9fdf4e6336d0b53a25836681ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,186,72,34,171,141,142,159,223,78,99,54,208,181,58,37,131,102,129,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
