Presenting outcomes of research published over the past six years, it offers guidelines from a scientifically oriented perspective, and employs new technologies and mathematical methods to assess golf putting. The chapters cover aspects such as pendulum-like motion in sports, setting up the experimental design, and performance metrics for putting variables. Paving the way for an improved understanding of what leads to failure and success in golf putting, this book offers an invaluable reference source for sports scientists, engineers and mathematicians, as well as golfers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f51cc206232433cdfdf997c537ac07c0aba9281f","amp;dn":"The+Science+of+Golf+Putting+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f51cc206232433cdfdf997c537ac07c0aba9281f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,28,194,6,35,36,51,205,253,249,151,197,55,172,7,192,171,169,40,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
