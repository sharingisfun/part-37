Use this if you need to change the language to English!\n\nPrerequisites: Install game first.\n\nSteps:\n\n1) Copy the contents of the English Fix files, that's the &quot;english&quot; folder you just downloaded, into the &quot;english&quot; directory, where you installed the game. I named the folders, and put them in their respective hierarchies, to make it easier for you.\n\n2) Run update1. Make sure you install it in the parent directory of the root game folder. That's the folder where the folder &quot;Call of Duty Advanced Warfare&quot; is in. Otherwise, it will create a folder in the game's directory, leaving you with two &quot;Call of Duty Advanced Warfare&quot; folders, and the update won't work. The RELOADED installer, for some reason, appends the name of the folder by default.  You may find it here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11382307/Call.of.Duty.Advanced.Warfare.Update.1-RELOADED\n\n3) Copy and paste the Crack from update1\n\n4) Delete the &quot;russian&quot; folder\n\n5) Run the game!\n\nRemember: If you like what you downloaded, buy it! Because if you don't, it will be the last time you will see great content being produced","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac4460426b443e274df0b420a60ed86d2146f276","amp;dn":"Call+of+Duty+Advanced+Warfare+English+Fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac4460426b443e274df0b420a60ed86d2146f276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,68,96,66,107,68,62,39,77,240,180,32,166,14,216,109,33,70,242,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
