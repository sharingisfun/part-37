Most of these tracks come from the '30s when Western swing was at its most vital. Although a good collection, it is obviously targeted toward folks who are already converts to the genre. It does not concern itself with presenting the best and the brightest, but with giving a good overview of the state of the music during those years. Thus, if one is trying to turn someone onto Western swing, one would be better off having them listen to a good Bob Wills or Milton Brown compilation. When there are 28 tracks to fill, it's not easy to come up with selections of equal quality. Therefore, this is not as energetic and involving as earlier compilations from Rambler (Hot as I Am, Devil with the Devil, Texas Sand). However, this CD is sure to please hardcore fans. It includes rare tracks from transcriptions and acetates that would be otherwise hard to find. Most importantly, it does not leave you hanging by including tracks from obscure groups and not telling you any information about them. Nite Spot Blues has 27 pages of liner notes, band photos, session rosters and a detailed bibliography. One might need a score sheet to keep track of the shifting personnel, but record hounds always prefer a surfeit of information to a dirth. ~Megan Lynch (Allmusic)\n\n01.
