This is almost contemporaneous with the events it describes.  Actually, this is a low-budget dramatization based on &quot;what if?&quot; speculations.  Authorities at the time were hoping that publicity-hungry Zodiac would attend this film, be outraged by it and cough up more information about himself.  Whether that ever happened I don't know. This film is a creepy black comedy, when all is said and done. Grover is one of my favorite characters in low-budget\n\nHitch Hike to Hell (1977) - almost looks like a made-for-tv movie but it's really too low-budget for tv.  A mama's boy (Howard) in a sunbaked California town picks up hitch hikers (mostly young women) and lectures them about his own sister who presumably hitch hiked on out of there when she ran away from home, breaking her mama's heart. Then he rapes and kills them. (I hope I'm not giving away the story here.) Apart from that peccadillo, Howard's really a nice guy. From the Harry Novak Box Office International vaults. Russell Johnson (the Professor from &quot;Gilligan's Island&quot;) has a big part as a police Captain who sadly investigates the killings.\n\nTorrent includes the 2 feature films and trailer for HITCH HIKE TO HELL.\n\n\nVideo Format: MP4 (Nero Digital) at 800 to 900 kbs (variable)\n480 x 368\nConverted directly from DVD-R.\n\nAudio: AAC 2ch at 128 kbs\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9f959574de57a7c8316cdff78a42ba61b90564","amp;dn":"The+Zodiac+Killer+%281971%29+%2B+Hitch+Hike+to+Hell+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9f959574de57a7c8316cdff78a42ba61b90564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,159,149,149,116,222,87,167,200,49,108,223,247,138,66,186,97,185,5,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
