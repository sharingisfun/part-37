Torn between his sense of duty towards her and his love for Tuli, his demanding girlfriend, Jay struggles to make a successful careerÃ¢â‚¬â€A small-time client-servicing executive, he secretly dreams of becoming a copywriter some day. But survival is an art Jay has yet to learn, as he finds his ambitions and romantic desires ruthlessly stifled by the same city that nurtured them.\nFirst published in 1993, Vertigo, with its fierce narrative energy and intensity, has acquired cult status as the quintessential Bombay novel.\n\nUser Review\nWith no punches pulled, Vertigo is one of the grittiest tales of survival, ambition,and sexual frustration in modern Bombay (Mumbai). \n\nTwo emotions that are explored very effectively in this book are lust and anger. The author goes into great detail to explain the extent of the character's sexual desire, and his rage at not getting any. Unforgiving Bombay with all its dirt and squalor is described in uncomfortable detail (the author describes one location as smelling of &quot;garlic farts&quot;), and the 'life goes on' ethos of India's largest metropolis is tough to digest.\n\nCaveat: The emotions in this book are very real, and permeate through the pages effortlessly. For the hours you are absorbed in this book, you are the main character, Jay. And that's a lot to handle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1c8c86166f55a19efd22ca0019af3e3cd947aa6","amp;dn":"Vertigo+%28Mumbai+Noir%29+-+Ashok+Banker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1c8c86166f55a19efd22ca0019af3e3cd947aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,200,200,97,102,245,90,25,239,210,44,160,1,154,243,227,205,148,122,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
