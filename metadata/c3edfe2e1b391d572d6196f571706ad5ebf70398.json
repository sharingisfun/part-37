Lee (Rhys Darby) is a young, skilled OBGYN who lacks confidence when it comes to talking to women outside his successful medical practice. A minor injury temporarily lands him in a wheelchair and it is at that precise time that he meets his dream girl Alex (Sasha Alexander). Convinced sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only paid attention to him because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in that chair, he stays in it to win her affections well after his injury has healed. Coming &amp; Going is about love and the extreme things people do for it.\n\nRelease Group: AQOS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (P2P)\nRelease Name: Coming.and.Going.2012.DVDRip.XviD-AQOS\nRelease Date: August 19, 2013\nFilename: Coming.and.Going.2012.DVDRip.XviD-AQOS\nSource: DVD\nSize: 700 MB\nGenre: Comedy\nVideo: XviD | 656Ãƒâ€”352 | 1 053 Kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 128 kbps\nSubs: N/A\nIMDB Rating: 5.2/10\nRT Critics: N/A\nDirected By: Edoardo Ponti\nStarring: Rhys Darby, Sasha Alexander, Fionnula Flanagan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3edfe2e1b391d572d6196f571706ad5ebf70398","amp;dn":"Coming+and+Going+2012+DVDRip+XviD-AQOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3edfe2e1b391d572d6196f571706ad5ebf70398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,237,254,46,27,57,29,87,45,97,150,245,113,112,106,213,235,247,3,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
