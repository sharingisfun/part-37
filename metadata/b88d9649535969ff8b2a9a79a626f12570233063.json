Everything from JavaScript libraries to RIA plugins, RFID readers to smart phones can consume your services using platform-agnostic HTTP.\n\nWith such wide accessibility, securingyour code effectively needs to be a top priority. You will quickly find that the WCF security protocols youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re familiar with from .NET (WS-* and similar)are less suitable than they once were in this new environment; proving themselves cumbersome and limited in terms of the standards they can work with.\n\nFortunately, ASP.NET Web API provides asimple robust security solution of its own that fits neatly within the ASP.NET MVC programming model and secures your code without the need for SOAP meaningthat there is no limit to the range of devices that it can work with Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if it can understand HTTP then it can be secured by Web API. These SOAP-less security techniques are the focus of this book.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- Identity management and cryptography\n- HTTP basic and digest authentication and Windows authentication\n- HTTP advanced concepts such as web caching, ETag, and CORS\n- Ownership factors of API keys, client X.509 certificates, and SAML tokens\n- Simple Web Token (SWT) and signed and encrypted JSON Web Token (JWT)\n- OAuth 2.0 from the ground up using JWT as the bearer token\n- OAuth 2.0 authorization codes and implicit grants using DotNetOpenAuth\n- Two-factor authentication using Google Authenticator\n- OWASP Top Ten risks for 2013\n\nWho this book is for\nNo prior experience of .NET-security is needed to read this book. All security related concepts will be introduced from first-principles and developed to the point where you can use them confidently in a professional environment. A goodworking knowledge and experience of C# and the .NET framework are the onlypre-requisites to benefit from this book.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1. Welcome to ASP.NET Web API\nChapter 2.
