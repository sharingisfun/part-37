After graduation and two summers spent exploring Europe, he was obliged to clerk for an attorney. A sinecure, the job allowed him to devote most of his time to literature and his own writing. In 1920, he began lecturing in Kiev on theater and music. The lectures continued in Moscow, where he moved in 1922, by then well known in literary circles. Lodged in a cell-like room on the Arbat, Krzhizhanovsky wrote steadily for close to two decades. His philosophical and phantasmagorical fictions ignored injunctions to portray the Soviet state in a positive light. Three separate efforts to print collections were quashed by the censors, a fourth by World War II. Not until 1989 could his work begin to be published. Like Poe, Krzhizhanovsky takes us to the edge of the abyss and forces us to look into it. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am interested,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“not in the arithmetic, but in the algebra of life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book:\n\n* Autobiography of a Corpse - Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky, introduction by Adam Thirlwell, a new translation from the Russian by Joanne Turnbull, 256 pp. (NYRB, 2013) -- ePUB\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe stakes are wildly high in Sigizmund KrzhizhanovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantastic and blackly comic philosophical fables, which abound in nested narratives and wild paradoxes. This new collection of eleven mind-bending and spellbinding tales includes some of KrzhizhanovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most dazzling conceits: a provincial journalist who moves to Moscow finds his existence consumed by the autobiography of his roomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous occupant; the fingers of a celebrated pianistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right hand run away to spend a night alone on the city streets; a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifelong quest to bite his own elbow inspires both a hugely popular circus act and a new refutation of Kant. Ordinary reality cracks open before our eyes in the pages of Autobiography of a Corpse, and the extraordinary spills out.\n\n\n                                    ** QUOTES **\n\nSly, vibrant, and often very funny, KrzhizhanovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stories, originally written in the 1920s and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢30s (though virtually unpublished during the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifetime), are a joyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Full of precise detail, this book will instruct, delight, and then leave the reader pondering long after the reading is finished.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly\n\nThe stories in this collection by the early Soviet writer Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky are nearly as fantastic as the crashing combination of consonants at the beginning of his surname. \nÃ¢â‚¬â€ The New York Times Book Review\n\nKrzhizhanovsky is one of the greatest Russian writers of the last century.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Robert Chandler, Financial Times\n\nAs to the question of why he still deserves to be read, these stories represent strong entries in two different traditions of Russian literature: firstly, the unhinged, feverishly experimental universe, in which a pianistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fingers can detach themselves from his hand and flee down the aisle of the concert hall, or where a cold man on the streets of Moscow can remove a strip of paper from a notepad and jot something down, transmogrifying the paper into Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlodgings measuring one hundred square feet.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Secondly, the grand woe of Dostoyevsky, in which is expressed the physic trauma of a frozen country so frequently torn asunder by ideology.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Daily Beast\n\nSly, vibrant, and often very funny, KrzhizhanovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stories, originally written in the 1920s and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢30s (though virtually unpublished during the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifetime), are a joyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Full of precise detail, this book will instruct, delight, and then leave the reader pondering long after the reading is finished.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Huffington Post\n\nIn ThirlwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughtful introduction, the British novelist declares that KrzhizhanovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mode is Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe most useful vehicle available for the most intricate philosophy.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ This vehicle is also among the most palatable: If KrzhizhanovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stories are intricately philosophic, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re delivered in such an entertaining manner that the medicine goes down quite pleasantly indeed.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Boston Globe\n\nKrzhizhanovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s morbidly satiric imagination forms the wild (missing) link between the futuristic dream tales of Edgar Allan Poe and the postwar scientific nightmares of Stanislaw Lem Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ an impish master of the fatalistically fantastic.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Bill Marx, The World\n\nKrzhizhanovsky is often compared to Borges, Swift, Poe, Gogol, Kafka, and Beckett, yet his fiction relies on its own special mixture of heresy and logic.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Natasha Randall, Bookforum\n\nThere is no blackness in this authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s humour, not even in such a story as Ã¢â‚¬ËœAutobiography of a Corpse,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ which in its mild and amiable way, gives the impression of being what the title says it is. For a writer Krzhizhanovsky himself sounds an unusually nice man. His work, subtly subversive, as his editor rightly calls it, only started to be published as a whole in 1989, when what might be described as all the usual suspects, Kafka and Borges, Swift, Gogol and of course Samuel Beckett, were promptly trotted out by way of comparison. Krzhizhanovsky has certainly much in common with them, but the flavour and personality of his writing is all his own, as if it were a subdued and friendly personal conversation. His method, as he put it, was not to borrow from reality, but to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœask reality for permission to use his own imagination.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Spectator\n\nKrzhizhanovsky wanted to perform imaginary experiments with the nature of time and space. Outside, in the streets, the Communist state was busy performing such experiments for real. In response, KrzhizhanovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prose has a recklessly unstable tone in which delighted examination of impossible worlds can slip into ferocious political sarcasmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. It is a method for investigating how much unreality reality can bear.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Adam Thirlwell, The New York Review of Books\n\nThere was probably no worse time and place to be a postmodernist sage than in 1920s Russia. Still, bibliophiles like to believe that genius makes itself known, regardless of social pressures, and in the case of Ukraine-born Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky, they may have a pointÃ¢â‚¬â€only it took about six decades for anyone else to catch onÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. For all the cemeteryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Krzhizhanovsky is also hilarious, and one wonders whether that might have troubled the Bolsheviks as much as anything in his work. Krzhizhanovsky understood the potency of juxtaposing wit with terror and the sacred with the profane.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Los Angeles Times\n\n[A]n awareness has grown that Krzhizhanovsky belongs with the best of the Russian prose writers who came to maturity in the post-Revolutionary decade. Like them, he sought and developed a new aesthetic in an altered world; and like them, he was soon thrown back on himself.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Oliver Ready, Times Literary Supplement\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigizmund_Krzhizhanovsky&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigizmund_Krzhizhanovsky&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/sigizmund-krzhizhanovsky/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/sigizmund-krzhizhanovsky/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603508c0828f9e0f0631c723be43809ce7673b53","amp;dn":"Autobiography+of+a+Corpse+-+Short+Stories+%28NYRB%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603508c0828f9e0f0631c723be43809ce7673b53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,53,8,192,130,143,158,15,6,49,199,35,190,67,128,156,231,103,59,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
