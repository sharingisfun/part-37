The diversity of the material on the album highlighted\nthe skill with which Morrison could fuse Celtic folk, R&amp;B, blues, jazz and the \nsinger-songwriter genre. &quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)&quot; and the title track, top quality blends of Stax soul and folk, became staples of his live set,while lesser known tracks such as &quot;Gypsy&quot; and &quot;Redwood Tree&quot; continued to display a lyrical celebration of nature's beauty.\n\nAlso on the album were two lengthy, hypnotic tracks, &quot;Listen to the Lion&quot; and the closing &quot;Almost Independence Day&quot; which were given primal, cathartic and intense vocal performances from Morrison. These tracks were more similar to the songs on his critically lauded 1968 song cycle Astral Weeks.\n\nRolling Stone Magazine declared it &quot;the best-produced, most ambitious Van Morrison\nrecord yet released.&quot; It ranks at #36 at Rate Your Music's Top Albums of 1972.\n\nThe disc was ripped to flac using EAC.  The upload includes \ncue sheet, log file, playlist and artwork.
