Crisp, elegant liner notes by Rolling Stone writer David Fricke put us squarely in Kurt Cobain's mindset as he entered a Seattle studio in January 1994--a full two days later than expected--to record what would be his final session with Nirvana. The resulting &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; locates Cobain at the apogee of his disenfranchisement with tongue nevertheless planted firmly in cheek. Bawdy, raucous, and venomous, &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; could have been lifted from Nevermind. A mix of tracks from that album (&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; &quot;Come as You Are,&quot; &quot;Lithium,&quot; and &quot;In Bloom&quot;) sits opposite stuff from early EPs and the Bleach disc (&quot;About a Girl,&quot; &quot;Been a Son,&quot; and &quot;Sliver&quot;), plus two from the MTV Unplugged sessions and several more from In Utero.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs by Kurt Cobain unless otherwise noted:\n\n&quot;You Know You're Right&quot; (previously unreleased) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 \n&quot;About a Girl&quot; (from Bleach) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:49 \n&quot;Been a Son&quot; (from the Blew EP) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:23 \n&quot;Sliver&quot; (from Incesticide) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:14 \n&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; (from Nevermind) (Cobain/Grohl/Novoselic) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01 \n&quot;Come as You Are&quot; (from Nevermind) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39 \n&quot;Lithium&quot; (from Nevermind) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17 \n&quot;In Bloom&quot; (from Nevermind) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15 \n&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; (from In Utero) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41 \n&quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; (Scott Litt remix) (from the Pennyroyal Tea single) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 \n&quot;Rape Me&quot; (from In Utero) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51 \n&quot;Dumb&quot; (from In Utero) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34 \n&quot;All Apologies&quot; (from MTV Unplugged in New York) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51 \n&quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (David Bowie) (from MTV Unplugged in New York) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47 \n\n\n\n\nHope you enjoy this album as much as I have..
