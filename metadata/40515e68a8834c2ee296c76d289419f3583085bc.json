Utilizing New York session musicians such as Paul Griffin, Richard Tee, Eric Gale, Chuck Rainey, and Herb Lovell, Tate and Ragovoy produced, from 1966 to 1968, a series of soul blues recordings that are regarded as some of the most sophisticated of the era. &quot;Ain't Nobody Home&quot; (1966), &quot;Look at Granny Run Run&quot; (1966), &quot;Baby I Love You&quot; (1967), and &quot;Stop&quot; (1968) all written or co-written by Ragovoy, were well received by record buyers. &quot;Ain't Nobody Home&quot;, &quot;Look At Granny&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot; charted in the Top 20 in the US Billboard R&amp;B chart.\n\nJanis Joplin performed another of Tate's Ragavoy songs, &quot;Get It While You Can&quot;, (on Pearl) during this time.Tate's reputation among critics was high. As Robert Christgau wrote in his review of Tate's Verve material, &quot;Tate is a blues-drenched Macon native who had the desire to head north and sounds it every time he gooses a lament with one of the trademark keens that signify the escape he never achieved. He brought out the best in soul pro Jerry Ragovoy, who made Tate's records jump instead of arranging them into submission, and gave him lyrics with some wit to them besides.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40515e68a8834c2ee296c76d289419f3583085bc","amp;dn":"Howard+Tate+-+Get+It+While+You+Can+%281967%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40515e68a8834c2ee296c76d289419f3583085bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,81,94,104,168,131,76,46,226,150,199,109,40,148,25,243,88,48,133,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
