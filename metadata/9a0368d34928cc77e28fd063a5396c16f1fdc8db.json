The sleeve contains photography by Helmut Newton and Herb Ritts. The track &quot;You Were Great, How Was I?&quot; is a duet with Carl Wilson.\n\nThe album's title song reached #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts, Newton-John's last U.S. Top 40 Pop single to date in the U.S. and her second-to-last in Canada, and &quot;Bubbled Under&quot; the UK singles chart at #100. The follow-up single, &quot;Toughen Up,&quot; (written for Tina Turner but rejected by her as inferior) failed to chart entirely except for a minor chart placement in Australia.\n\nAlthough the album was not nearly as commercially successful as her previous efforts and barely made the Top 30 on the Billboard 200, it was certified Gold in both the U.S. and Australia and also charted at #5 in Japan. Opinions of the album are mixed among Olivia's fans, as some detractors see it as a continuation of her move into sexually suggestive territory begun four years earlier with &quot;Physical&quot; and an attempt to imitate the breakout success of Madonna over the previous year. Newton John was pregnant at the time of the release and was therefore unable to promote the album, although many critics argue that the uncharacteristic sexual nature of the cover photographs were the real reason for the album's downfall.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a0368d34928cc77e28fd063a5396c16f1fdc8db","amp;dn":"Olivia+Newton-John+-+Soul+Kiss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a0368d34928cc77e28fd063a5396c16f1fdc8db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,3,104,211,73,40,204,119,226,143,208,99,165,57,108,22,241,253,200,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
