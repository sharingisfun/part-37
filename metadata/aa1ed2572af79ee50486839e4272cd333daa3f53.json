It is widely known for its physical strength and retention of properties after long-term exposure to heat, oil and chemicals. The unique properties attributed to it have resulted in wide adoption of HNBR in automotive, industrial, and assorted, performance-demanding applications. This Practical Guide covers everything from the manufacture of HNBR to processing in the finished part production facility. This book forms a complete guide for the practising rubber formulator or process engineer dealing with HNBR technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa1ed2572af79ee50486839e4272cd333daa3f53","amp;dn":"Practical+Guide+to+Hydrogenated+Nitrile+Butadiene+Rubber+Technol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa1ed2572af79ee50486839e4272cd333daa3f53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,30,210,87,42,247,158,229,4,134,131,158,66,114,205,51,61,170,63,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
