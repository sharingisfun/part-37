They all want to achieve something in their lives - successful career, good marriage, worldwide popularity, rich boyfriend... The problem is that the real life is much more complicated than a dream. They all rent the same apartment, because they've all come from Saratov and have no relatives in Moscow. Living under one roof with your friends - that's the real misfortune, and that's when you find out who your real friend is. Or maybe it's not a misfortune, but a blessing?\n\nThe show was never translated into English, afaik, so I decided to try and translate the first episode, just for some training. I hope you'll enjoy it, and sorry for mistakes if there are any.\n\np.s. some Russian names written in Latin letters are absolutely hilarious or unpronounceable, like Bobilkina or Mikhailovich, sorry for that, too :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7ad6ca00be8284c272720d2936049912f8c198c","amp;dn":"Girlz+s01e01+%28Deffchonki%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7ad6ca00be8284c272720d2936049912f8c198c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,173,108,160,11,232,40,76,39,39,32,210,147,96,73,145,47,140,25,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
