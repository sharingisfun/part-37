The difference in both films are that the Pythons recreated all the sketches while Benny Hill used clips from the Thames years and edited them together to make the film.\n\nThe movie was produced and released in 1974 by Thames Television Ltd. via its feature-film subsidiary Euston Films and originally distributed by EMI Films. Current Worldwide Distribution by Canal + Image UK LTD.\n\nTechnical note\nThe original programmes were shot on videotape (studio interiors) and 16 mm film (location footage). For theatrical release the videotaped material was transferred to 35 mm film as a telerecording, and the 16 mm footage was blown up to 35 mm.\n\nWidth 720 Pixels\nHeight 544 Pixels\nDuration 1:26:39\nNTSC \n\nEnjoy!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d7912891c79b57aaaef9cb0cfb407f2141eb3a","amp;dn":"The+Best+Of+Benny+Hill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d7912891c79b57aaaef9cb0cfb407f2141eb3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,215,145,40,145,199,155,87,170,174,249,203,12,251,64,127,33,65,235,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
