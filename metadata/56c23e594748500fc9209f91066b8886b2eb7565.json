I liked the film, but the soundtrack is great. Track 8 (Alex Descends into Hell for a Bottle of Milk/Korova 1) is one of my top 10 songs of all time - try to find it elsewhere.\nThe only wastage on this disk is track 10, an obligatory bit of &quot;soundtrack&quot; music from the films composer. Everything else is really, really good. And yes, this is the disk that turned me on to Stabbing Westward. That is a good thing. \n\n\nThis album is the perfect flashback to the 90's when cheesy but fun sci-fi movies could be made for less than a billion dollars.  All the bands and songs harken back to the early days of techno and electronic music when many still had a punk/rock upbringing. These bands' music can still be found today by enterprising music gurus, and they are definitely worth the listen.
