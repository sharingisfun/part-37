They did however post this, whether it's totally new content that I'm not sure of but it is labeled as ep 213 so here it is. Hopefully Artie will be back Monday, if not check the comments of the last show posted for updates about why the next ep hasn't been posted.\r\n\r\nTake Care &amp; Don't Forget To Wash Your Undercarriage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e71a82b03c23dc99664fee8a945a09d19d768718","amp;dn":"The+Artie+Quitter+Podcast+FEB+25+2016+Thu.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e71a82b03c23dc99664fee8a945a09d19d768718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,26,130,176,60,35,220,153,102,79,238,138,148,90,9,209,157,118,135,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
