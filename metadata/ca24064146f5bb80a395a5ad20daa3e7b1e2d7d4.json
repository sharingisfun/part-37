Most are pdf, but quality varies widely.\n\n1. Anamnesis - Converted to pdf from html; html file included in the torrent; minimally formatted.\n2. From Enlightenment to Revolution - new pdf, based on older scan; I've cleaned up the previous version considerably.\n\nThe following are from the Collected Works - Quality is near-retail unless stated otherwise; in almost every case I've made improvements to the pdf as I found it, usually at least by adding the contents to bookmarks.\n\n3. The Authoritarian State (CW4)\n4. Modernity Without Restraint (CW5) - Alas, this important volume, which includes The New Science of Politics, is a very poor scan; it seems to be a web-rip and pages in the last section are seriously defective; many are simply missing. I've included it anyway for the sake of completeness. The first two sections are at least readable.\n5., 6., 7. Published Essays, 1934-1965 (CW9, CW10, CW11)\n8. Selected Book Reviews (CW13)\n9. History of Political Ideas, Volume 5 (CW23)- This one is another conversion from html, and the html file is included here as well as the pdf.\n10. History of Political Ideas, Volume 7 (CW25)\n11. Hitler and the Germans (CW31)\n12. The Theory of Governance and Other Miscellaneous Papers 1921-1938(CW32)\n13. The Drama of Humanity and Other Miscellaneous Papers 1939-1985 (CW33)\n\nAlso included is one article:\n14. The Philosophy of Existence: Plato's Gorgias\n\nI have not included The New Science of Politics (except as part of the badly formed CW5) because existing scans that I've found are all defective -- missing pages and marred with underlining, etc. I'm repairing the book now and will upload when I'm finished.\n\nI'll also be uploading some books about Voegelin soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca24064146f5bb80a395a5ad20daa3e7b1e2d7d4","amp;dn":"Eric+Voegelin+-+Misc.+Works+%28pdf%2C+mostly%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca24064146f5bb80a395a5ad20daa3e7b1e2d7d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,36,6,65,70,245,187,128,163,149,165,173,32,218,163,231,177,226,215,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
