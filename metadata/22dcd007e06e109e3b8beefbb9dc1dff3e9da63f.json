The Idea is 'suggest' Bands that some may not know that have a similar sound to The Black Keys. Something that Fans of TBK may enjoy.\n\nDon't like it? Don't download it... think my ideas are rubbish? I Don't care, It's free so stop whining like a baby. \n\nI Hope you find it interesting.  \n\nTrack List:\n\n1 Lonely boy (The Black keys)\n2 Luckydutch (Radio Moscow)\n3 Them Shoes (Patrick Sweany)\n4 Get Miles (Gomez)\n5 In Stereo (The Blackwater Fever)\n6 Hard Workin Man (Left Lane Cruiser)\n7 Mustang Ranch (Black Joe Lewis &amp; The Honeybears)\n8 All To Hell (Black Diamond Heavies)\n9 Diamonds (Dewolff)\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22dcd007e06e109e3b8beefbb9dc1dff3e9da63f","amp;dn":"The+Black+Keys+-+Not+Quite+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22dcd007e06e109e3b8beefbb9dc1dff3e9da63f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,220,208,7,224,110,16,158,59,139,238,251,185,220,29,255,62,157,166,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
