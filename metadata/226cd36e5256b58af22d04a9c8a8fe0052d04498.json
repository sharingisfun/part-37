A foul-mouthed memoir about a dysfunctional life. Each chapter recounts a key moment in the author's life through the books she was reading at the time including: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Howard's End, the only text she had read whilst engaging in sexual intercourse.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, which she had in her bag while on holiday in Tangier when a market trader offered her to buy her from her mother for 30 camels.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Angela's Ashes, her chosen reading material during her breast reduction surgery.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Wild Swans, the book she read the day she decided to have nothing more to do with her mother. It is funny, it is shocking, it is heartbreaking, it is very rude and it is totally unforgettable.\n\nIntroduction: I started writing a blog because I wanted to talk about books anonymously. The reason I did it anonymously was because I didn't, and still don't really, think that I am at all clever or insightful enough to have decent opinions on books. If I love them, I can't really tell you why; and if I hate them I tend to just swear a lot and get frustrated. The best and most fitting anonymous name that I could think of for me was BookC*nt.
