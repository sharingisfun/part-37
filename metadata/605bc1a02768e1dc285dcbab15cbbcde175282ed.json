These riff-heavy and radio-ready songs are underscored by a tight drum sound (often with a piccolo snare), the scratching of turntables, and the crunch of heavy guitars: a formidable backdrop for this surprisingly melodic effort. The rhythms of reggae and ska percolate through this mix, and the harmonies of Nick Hexum and S.A. Martinez lend the band an edge not found in the majority of bands that feature rapping over rock beats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:605bc1a02768e1dc285dcbab15cbbcde175282ed","amp;dn":"311+-+311+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"605bc1a02768e1dc285dcbab15cbbcde175282ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,91,193,160,39,104,225,220,40,93,203,171,21,203,188,222,23,82,130,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
