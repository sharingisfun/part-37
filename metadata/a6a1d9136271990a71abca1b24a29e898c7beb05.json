Additionally, Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent supports the Protocol Encryption joint specification (compatible with Azureus 2.4.0.0 and above, BitComet 0.63 and above) and peer exchange.\n\nResource-Friendly:\n\n Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent was written with efficiency in mind. Unlike many torrent clients, it does not hog valuable system resources - typically using less than 6MB of memory, allowing you to use the computer as if it weren\\'t there at all. Additionally, the program itself is contained within a single executable less than 220 KB in size.\n\nSkinnable and Localized:\n\n Various icon, toolbar graphic and status icon replacements are available, and creating your own is very simple. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent also has support for localization, and with a language file present, will automatically switch to your system language. If your language isn\\'t available, you can easily add your own, or edit other existing translations to improve them!\n\nActively Developed and Improved:\n\n The developer puts in a lot of time working on features and making things more user-friendly. Releases only come out when they\\'re ready, with no schedule pressures, so the few bugs that appear are quickly addressed and fixed.\n\nTechnical:-\n\nTitle:uTorrent 3.0 Build 25422\n Filename:utorrent-3.0-latest.exe\n File size:624KB (639,352 bytes)\n Requirements:Windows (All Versions)\n Languages:en-US\n License: Freeware\n Date added:July 9, 2011\n\nRelease Highlights:-\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent Web for zero-conf, secure remote access\n\n Torrent Ratings\n\n Drop files to send\n\n Streaming\n\n Webseeding fixes\n\n Portable mode (when run in standalone mode off a removable drive)\n\n Simplified view\n\nChangelog:-\n\n- 2011-07-08: Version 3.0 Stable (build 25440)\n - Fix: fix erroneous error messages about saving resume.dat\n - Fix: fix possible crash on auto-updates\n - Fix: fixed race condition when cancelling a btapp download\n - Fix: fixed possible crash when uninstalling apps\n - Fix: Multitorrent bundling now works.
