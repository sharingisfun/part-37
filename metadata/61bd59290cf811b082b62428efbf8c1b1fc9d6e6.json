When he wakes up on Easter, months later, muttering the LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prayer in the original Aramaic, the media is set abuzz about the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miracle Man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Religious fanatics flock to ZackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hospital bedside, though he claims to be an atheist.\n\nZackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revival also catches the attention of Dr. Elizabeth Luria, who heads up a small team of neuroscientists secretly researching near-death experiences (NDE). Their objective: to determine if there is anything to the claims of NDE victims about floating down tunnels into the celestial light and meeting spiritual beings. Is all that evidence of the afterlife? Or is it just neurobiology, as Sarah Wyman, one of LuriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s young researchers suspects.\n\nFor personal reasons, Luria is desperate to prove the afterlife exists. So are her wealthy, evangelist backers, who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to announce the greatest discovery in human history: that God exists. A discovery that would at last reconcile science and religion. A discovery that would end the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s religious strife and unite all humanity.\n\nYet ZackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiences are anything but heavenly. While he and Sarah struggle to understand his horrific out-of-body experiences, they have no idea that sinister forces have taken an interest in them. Forces to whom near-death experiences are utter blasphemyÃ¢â‚¬â€deceptions by Satan himself. They enlist a menacing agent who, in the name of God, will stop at nothing to terminate the project and all involved.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61bd59290cf811b082b62428efbf8c1b1fc9d6e6","amp;dn":"Tunnel+Vision+by+Gary+Braver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61bd59290cf811b082b62428efbf8c1b1fc9d6e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,189,89,41,12,248,17,176,130,182,36,40,239,191,140,27,31,201,214,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
