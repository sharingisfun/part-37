Scott takes that same highly acclaimed, casual, straight-to-the-point concept and layout and brings it to learning AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazing iPhone. Scott teams up once again with gadget guru and leading iPhone authority Terry White to put together a book that is an awful lot like the iPhone itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€œsimple to use and fun to learn. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s layout is brilliant, with each page covering just one single topic, so finding the information you need is quick and easy, with a large full-color photo on each page so you can see exactly how it works.\n\nContents\nChapter One.
