Poetry, photography (I think it is the best photography I&amp;#039;ve ever seen in a movie) and music in an amazing movie THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND because it&amp;#039;s in Greek (no English subtitles in the release I&amp;#039;ve got).\n\nYou don&amp;#039;t need to understand their words to feel it, to cry and to laugh when the moment comes. Angelopoulos has made, in my honest opinion, a master piece of theater-movie.\n\nBuy it, keep it, show it to your children, to your parents...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b724c83c427ae704d9a68a58369b668f545d94c","amp;dn":"Theo+Angelopoulos+-+Eternity+and+a+Day+-+1998+-+Gr%C3%A9cia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b724c83c427ae704d9a68a58369b668f545d94c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,114,76,131,196,39,174,112,77,154,104,165,131,105,182,104,245,69,217,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
