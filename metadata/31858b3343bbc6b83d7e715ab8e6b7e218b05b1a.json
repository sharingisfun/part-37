The new ad continues the silhouette dancer theme and features [b]Mi Swing Es Tropical[/b] by [i]Nickodemus &amp; Quantic[/i] featuring [i]Tempo[/i][/quote]\n\nWatch the ad on [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp5kHEzv70]Youtube[/url]\n\nI&amp;#039;m sure I&amp;#039;m not the only one who saw this ad and fell in love with the song and  the bright, vibrant colours and energy of the ad.  I tracked the song down and thought I would share it with others who might also be looking for it.  This is the full version of the song that plays in the ad.  It&amp;#039;s a great ad and summer tune that both capture the vibrancy and joy for life that exudes from Latin American culture and music.    Enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31858b3343bbc6b83d7e715ab8e6b7e218b05b1a","amp;dn":"song+for+new+Apple+iPod+%2B+iTunes+TV+Ad+-+Mi+Swing+Es+Tropica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31858b3343bbc6b83d7e715ab8e6b7e218b05b1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,133,139,51,67,187,198,184,61,126,113,90,184,230,183,226,24,176,91,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
