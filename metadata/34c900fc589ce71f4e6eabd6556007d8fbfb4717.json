Burt Lancaster is the timeworn Joe Collins, who, along with his fellow inmates, lives under the heavy thumb of the sadistic, power-tripping guard Captain Munsey. Only CollinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams of escape keep him going, but how can he possibly bust out of MunseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chains? Matter-of-fact and ferocious, Brute Force builds to an explosive climax that shows the lengths men will go to when fighting for their freedom.\n\nBDRip\nVideo: 960x720 AVC x264 @ 2400 Kbps\nAudio: AC3 @ 256 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34c900fc589ce71f4e6eabd6556007d8fbfb4717","amp;dn":"Brute.Force_1947_720p.BDRip.x264.ac3.mkv_eng-spa.srt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34c900fc589ce71f4e6eabd6556007d8fbfb4717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,201,0,252,88,156,231,31,78,110,171,214,85,96,7,216,251,251,71,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
