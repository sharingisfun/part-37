No crack or serial required - simply install and use!\n\n\\&quot;LightMachine is a plugin for performing all kinds of light adjustments in photos. It combines shadow/highlight, virtual lighting and color-based correction tools for performing sophisticated corrections without the need for time-consuming selections and layer stacks. It lets you selectively correct photos taken under bad light conditions or with inadequate camera settings and achieve results that rival photos taken under the best circumstances. Additionally LightMachine can achieve special effects like glows, sunsets, high key and selective b/w effects, replace one color with another and simulate polarizing filters. LightMachine works in dozens of graphics applications including Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, IrfanView, Photoshop Elements, PhotoImpact, Photo-Paint and Fireworks.\\&quot;\n--&gt; www.thepluginsite.com &lt;--","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fedad9f5d12c2d1270f6bb316219057dd2405da5","amp;dn":"Light+Machine+v1.02+plugin+for+Adobe+Photoshop.+Retail+version.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fedad9f5d12c2d1270f6bb316219057dd2405da5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,218,217,245,209,44,45,18,112,246,187,49,98,25,5,125,210,64,93,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
