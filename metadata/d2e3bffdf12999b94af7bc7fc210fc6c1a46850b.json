Make your own mind up as to whether that's because the peodophile's in government were too protetcted or not.  Did the media cave in to the elite's influence and censor public knowledge of this monstrous abomination that still exists at large to this day?  Today, society fails to realize that child trafficing is a larger crime syndicate than drugs.  Maybe this documentary may provide insight as to why it is allowed to continue with minimum media coverage.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSanta's Workshop - Inside China's Slave Labour Toy Factories:\r\nSometimes we have no choice, we work till dawn. When you work all night you become dizzy and your eyes hurt because you can't take any breaks. SANTA'S WORKSHOP takes you to the real world of China's toy factories. Workers tell us about long working hours, low wages, and dangerous work places. Those who protest or try to organize trade unions risk imprisonment. Low labor costs attract more and more companies to China. Today more than 75% of our toys are made in China. But this industry takes its toll on the workers and on the environment.\r\n\r\nThe European (and American) buyers blame bad conditions on the Chinese suppliers. But they say that increasingly hard competition gives them no option. Who should we believe? And what can you do to bring about a fairer and more humane toy trade?\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Franklin Coverup Investigations by Ted Gunderson:\r\nTed Gunderson Speech to Congressional Hearing on Child Protection \r\n\r\nSan Bernardino, California\r\nMarch 13, 2004\r\nTown Hall Forum with Congressman Joe Baca\r\n&quot;Children Protective Services Reform&quot;\r\n\r\nRespectfully Presented by Ted L. Gunderson, FBI Senior Special Agent In Charge (Ret).\r\n\r\nHonorable Lawmakers, Guardians of the United States Constitution and the Federal Treasury,\r\nI am a licensed private investigator with more than 54 years experience. This includes more than 27 years as a special agent with the FBI. At the time of my retirement on March 30, 1979, I was in charge of the FBI LOS ANGELES Division, which included most of Southern California. I had more than 700 personnel under my command, with a budget of 22.5 Million Dollars. \r\n\r\nAs a licensed private investigator I have specialized in exposing graft, corruption, and illegal, criminal activity involving public officials. The tentacles of these investigations have involved public officials at all levels of government: city, county, state and federal, and have reached as high as the White House. Most disturbing of all I have â€œchiseled in stoneâ€ documentation of an international criminal enterprise involving kidnapping, murders, including human sacrifices by Satanic Cults, and other nefarious criminal activity on the part of public officials and leading citizens in various communities. Specifically, in regards to Child Protective Services in some areas and some states, I have been told by a reliable source, that a planeload of 210 children from CPS was flown out of Denver, Colorado on November 6, 1997 to Paris, France. Later a second plane of children also under the care of CPS was flown from Los Angeles to Europe. I have also developed information through credible and reliable sources that in the past, children have been taken from Foster Homes, orphanages, and Boys Town Nebraska, and flown by private jets from Sioux City Iowa to Washington D.C. for sex orgies with politicians","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2e3bffdf12999b94af7bc7fc210fc6c1a46850b","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+79+-+Human+Trafficking+A+Bigger+Problem+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2e3bffdf12999b94af7bc7fc210fc6c1a46850b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,227,191,253,241,41,153,185,74,247,188,127,194,16,252,108,26,70,133,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
