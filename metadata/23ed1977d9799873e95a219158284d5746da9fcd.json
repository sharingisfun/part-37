ENJoY!\n\n\n\nGhana Ancient Ceremonies Songs \nQuality: 128Kbps \n\nGhana: Ancient Ceremonies, Songs, and Dance Music \n(WEA/Nonesuch) \n\nA close relationship exists between language and music in Ghana (as in most of Africa). Instruments can convey specific messages by imitating the patterns of pitch change in the words of African languages. These patterns, almost unknown in European languages, are actually short melodic phrases comprised of two or three adjacent tones of a diatonic scale. Since the patterns are constant for each word, musicians are able to &quot;talk&quot; with their instruments by reproducing the pitches alone. This album was recorded in the Brong-Ahafo, Eastern, Western, and Upper Regions of Ghana and reflects the rich diversity of traditional musical forms alive in Ghana today. \n\n\n\n\n* DOGUMBO SONG \n* DZIL DUET \n* GONJE SONG \n* DONNO DRUMMERS \n* KASSENA-NANKANI FESTIVAL \n* AHANTA CHANT I \n* AHANTA CHANT II \n* WIIKS AND MPINTINTOA \n* MARILLI \n* CHOHUN AND GYAMADUDU \n* DONNO DRUMMERS \n\nAfrica: Drum, Chant, and Instrumental Music \n(WEA/Nonesuch) \n\nIn the ceremonies and rituals celebrating birth, marriage, initiations, and formal religious worship, music prescribed for the occasion is performed by professional musicians and constitutes an essential element of the event. Ordinary daily activities are surrounded by many types of music, such as work songs, solo instrumental improvisations, medicinal music, the music of wandering minstrels, spontaneous songs, and music performed purely for the participants' enjoyment. \n\n\n\n* HAUSA STREET MUSIC (NIGER) \n* BOUNKAM SOLO (UPPER VOLTA) \n* KOUNTOUGI SOLO (NIGER) \n* DJERMA DUNDUNDRUMMERS (NIGER) \n* TUAREG MEDICINAL CHANT (MALI) \n* LODAGAA WIIKS AND GULU (GHANA) \n* SONGHAY KOMBI AND ETTEBEL (NIGER) \n* KOUCO SOLO (MALI) \n* SONGHAY GULU DRUMMERS (NIGER)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23ed1977d9799873e95a219158284d5746da9fcd","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Ghana+Ancient+Ceremonies+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23ed1977d9799873e95a219158284d5746da9fcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,237,25,119,217,121,152,115,233,90,33,145,88,40,77,87,70,218,159,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
