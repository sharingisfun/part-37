Drawing upon traditions from plainchant, mediaeval ars nova, Renaissance madrigals, 20th century vocal techniques and minimalism, ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music for acappella voice is some of his most personal and beloved creations. This is the definitive recording of his sublime, transcendent and radiant work inspired by the seductive lyricism of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest known erotic verse. Recorded by The Sapphites, the same all-star quintet that recorded ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first acappella masterwork Frammenti del Sappho in 2004, and the soon to be released Holy Visions, this is a sensual evocation of King SolomonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poetic aphrodisiac The Song of Songs, bathed in a gorgeous package replete with erotic fragrance and a sprig of myrrh.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8f6978fcb577d29b42f1534180ec5698b81480c","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Shir+Hashirim+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8f6978fcb577d29b42f1534180ec5698b81480c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,246,151,143,203,87,125,41,180,47,21,52,24,14,197,105,139,129,72,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
