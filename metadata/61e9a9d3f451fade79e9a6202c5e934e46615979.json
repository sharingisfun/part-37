Bennett\n\nPDF: 280 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press, USA (April 22, 1999)\n\n\nWomen brewed and sold most of the ale consumed in medieval England, but after 1350, men slowly took over the trade. By 1600, most brewers in London were male, and men also dominated the trade in many towns and villages. This book asks how, when, and why brewing ceased to be women's work and instead became a job for men. Employing a wide variety of sources and methods, Bennett vividly describes how brewsters (that is, female brewers) gradually left the trade. She also offers a compelling account of the endurance of patriarchy during this time of dramatic change.\n\nAbout the Author\nJudith M. Bennett is Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She has published extensively on the history of women, particularly women in the middle ages. Her books include Women in the Medieval English Countryside (Oxford, 1987) and Sisters and Workers in the Middle Ages (co-editor, 1989).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e9a9d3f451fade79e9a6202c5e934e46615979","amp;dn":"Ale%2C+Beer%2C+and+Brewsters+in+England%3A+Women%27s+Work+in+a+Changing+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e9a9d3f451fade79e9a6202c5e934e46615979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,233,169,211,244,81,250,222,121,233,166,32,44,94,147,78,70,97,89,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
