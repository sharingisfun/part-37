The three main building blocks of high-performance networks are links, switching equipment connecting the links together and software employed at the end nodes and intermediate switches. This book provides the basic techniques for modeling and analyzing these last two components. Topics covered include, but are not limited to: Markov chains and queuing analysis, traffic modeling, interconnection networks and switch architectures and buffering strategies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdda5b5ab2f38a65693374c577d088a10fb89873","amp;dn":"Analysis+of+Computer+Networks%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdda5b5ab2f38a65693374c577d088a10fb89873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,218,91,90,178,243,138,101,105,51,116,197,119,208,136,161,15,184,152,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
