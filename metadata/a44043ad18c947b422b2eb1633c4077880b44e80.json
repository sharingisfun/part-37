Serial killer's mom\n\n Kimsy (Kirsten Jakobsen) run away from her home, after yet another\n fight with her mom (Toril Skansen). She walks into the woods, where\n she normally can calm herself down. There she meets a helpful\n naturephotographer. Little does she know that this will be the\n beginning of the most depraved, bloodiest and horrific day of her\n life, when she is lured into a living hell, cleverly directed by a\n very brutal and extreme serialkiller.\n\n At the same time we go back to the 1960s, we are following the life\n of a small boy (Carl Arild Heffermehl). He lives together with his\n mom, far away in the deep woods of Trysil, Norway. His father died a\n long time ago and his mom (Sonja Bredesen) fills the house with new\n lovers every weekend, alcohol, beating and severe punishment. And the\n boys anger grows only stronger and stronger...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44043ad18c947b422b2eb1633c4077880b44e80","amp;dn":"Thrill.Of.A.Kill.2011.NORWEGiAN.English.Sub.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44043ad18c947b422b2eb1633c4077880b44e80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,64,67,173,24,201,71,180,34,178,235,22,51,196,7,120,128,180,78,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
