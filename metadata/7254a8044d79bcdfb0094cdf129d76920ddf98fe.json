For .NET developers, especially, adopting these new approaches and the tools that support them can require rethinking the development process altogether.\n\nContinuous Integration in .NET is a tutorial for developers and team leads that teaches readers how to re-imagine their development strategy by creating a consistent continuous integration process. This book shows how to build on the tools they already know Ã¢â‚¬â€œ .NET Framework and Visual Studio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and to use powerful software like MSBuild, Subversion, TFS 2010, Team City, CruiseControl.NET, NUnit, and Selenium.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7254a8044d79bcdfb0094cdf129d76920ddf98fe","amp;dn":"Continuous+Integration+in+NET+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7254a8044d79bcdfb0094cdf129d76920ddf98fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,84,168,4,77,121,188,223,176,9,76,223,18,157,118,146,13,223,152,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
