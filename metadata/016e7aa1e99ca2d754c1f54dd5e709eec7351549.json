Contains a few of Neil's lesser known classics (Mideast Vacation, Too Lonely, Prisoner of Rock n Roll) as well as one of his all-time worse songs, Inca Queen, which still manages to have a gorgeous melody. Around the World is sung with great passion &amp; anger. Very much a mixed bag. But if you're a fan, you'll have to own it eventually\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/ [/url] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:016e7aa1e99ca2d754c1f54dd5e709eec7351549","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+%26amp%3B+Crazy+Horse...Life%281987%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"016e7aa1e99ca2d754c1f54dd5e709eec7351549","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,110,122,161,233,156,162,215,84,193,245,77,213,231,9,238,199,53,21,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
