Chris Taylor (from Total Annihilation) showed Dungeon Siege years in production for the first time at E3 2000. The Mac version was published by MacSoft and released on April 25, 2003.\n\nThe gameplay  is a mixture of pause-and-go tactical management and point-and-click action. The mechanic is highly similar to that of latter Ultima games (so much so that fans have recreated certain Ultima titles using the Dungeon Siege engine), and to a lesser degree, action RPGs like Diablo or early action role-playing games like Nox. The Dungeon Siege quest is highly linear and involves constant hack and slash battle, similar in some ways to platform and beat 'em up games.\n\nThe game engine allows content creation and modification through a released toolkit. New content and modifications are called mods or siegelets. There are many mods created by amateurs available for download on the internet, with features ranging from new graphics to completely new character development systems.\n\n    * In this thrilling combination of in-depth role-playing and non-stop action, you'll plunge into a 3D world where you face an army of evil\n    * As you travel to see the world, your character will learn new skills and start on the path of the warrior\n    * Travel with a fully-customizable party with up to 8 characters -- it's up to you to lead them into battle against monsters and marauders\n    * Simple but engaging gameplay that lets you choose your own path - Fight for the sake of action, or just collect treasure until you're wealthy\n    * Gigantic, continuous 3D world immerses you into fantastic gameplay, through enormous castles and secret underground lairs\n\nNotable mods: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.u5lazarus.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.u5lazarus.com/&lt;/a&gt; - Ultima V: Lazarus ('Warriors Of Destiny' remake) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://u6project.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://u6project.com/&lt;/a&gt; - Ultima VI Project ('The False Prophet' remake)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de78d33873a50b648a0045f1ee4d184c535eea98","amp;dn":"Dungeon+Siege+1.2+%5BMAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de78d33873a50b648a0045f1ee4d184c535eea98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,120,211,56,115,165,11,100,138,0,69,241,238,77,24,76,83,94,234,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
