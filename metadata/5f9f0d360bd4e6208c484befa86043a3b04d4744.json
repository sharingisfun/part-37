The\ngraphics used in games are real-time computer graphics. This means a lot of\nthe information discussed in this book also applies to other graphical-\nrelated industries that use either real-time or non-real-time graphics, but\nour focus will be primarily on video games. Since this book focuses on\ngame graphics, we will examine many different real-time techniques as\nwell as some non-real-time techniques that can be preprocessed and used\nin games, which is very common in video games today.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f9f0d360bd4e6208c484befa86043a3b04d4744","amp;dn":"Game+Graphics+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f9f0d360bd4e6208c484befa86043a3b04d4744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,159,13,54,11,212,230,32,140,72,75,239,168,96,67,163,176,77,71,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
