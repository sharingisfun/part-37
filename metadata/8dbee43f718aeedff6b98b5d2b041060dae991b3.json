It requires the use of several major Civil 3D featuresÃ¢â‚¬â€alignments, profiles, and corridorsÃ¢â‚¬â€and an understanding of how they fit together in a complete road-design model. Eric Chappell shows you how to use these features to establish the path of your road, specify elevations, and define the makeup and cross-sectional elements of your design. The final chapter contains bonus tutorials on designing intersectionsÃ¢â‚¬â€complex traffic junctions that Civil 3D makes surprisingly simple to design.\nTopics include:\nEstablishing the road centerline using an alignment\nCapturing and defining road elevations with profiles\nDesigning the road cross-section using an assembly\nBuilding a 3D model of the road using a corridor\nCreating sections views of your design\nDesigning intersections","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dbee43f718aeedff6b98b5d2b041060dae991b3","amp;dn":"Basic+Roadway+Design+with+Civil+3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dbee43f718aeedff6b98b5d2b041060dae991b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,190,228,63,113,138,238,223,246,185,139,93,43,4,16,96,218,233,145,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
