Emerging ... Full Descriptionfrom the pack with a unique sound of their own have been regional sensations such as Counting Crows, Collective Soul, Hootie &amp; The Blowfish and now, the Dave Matthews Band. \n\nCentered around the talents of their lead singer-guitarist, and featuring some of the top talents on the Charlottesville, Virginia scene, UNDER THE TABLE AND DREAMING is an exquisite polyglot of voices and moods. As their closing instrumental &quot;#34&quot; demonstrates, the Dave Matthews Band not only possess a sublime pop sensibility, they're able to move seamlessly from rock through jazz, blues, funk and a variety of pastoral folk sources--all the while maintaining a distinctive lyric perspective. \n\nWith a slamming, sensitive rhythm section, and powerful solo flights by violinist Boyd Tinsley and saxophonist Leroi Moore, the Dave Matthews Band keeps several pots boiling all the time. Their vigorous group interplay compliments the leader's driving acoustic guitar, grainy, soulful vocals and gentle ambiguities on &quot;Typical Situation,&quot; and his harrowing tale of addiction, &quot;Rhyme &amp; Reason.&quot; Matthews' sly humor emerges on the sardonic &quot;Dancing Nancies,&quot; where he agonizes over every variety of woulda, coulda and shoulda on top of a dancing flamenco groove, and the funky &quot;What Would You Say,&quot; where his character urges us to live our lives, not lament them. UNDER THE TABLE AND DREAMING is positive, upbeat, exploratory pop. \n\nRecorded at Bearsville Studios, Bearsville, New York. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd1a7fc27cd54edd6e03ef319b5ae80965e37e35","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+Band+-+Under+the+Table+and+Dreaming+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd1a7fc27cd54edd6e03ef319b5ae80965e37e35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,26,127,194,124,213,78,221,110,3,239,49,155,90,232,9,101,227,126,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
