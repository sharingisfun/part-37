Get HDDLife - a real time hard drive monitoring utility with alerts, malfunction protection and data loss prevention functions. This hard-drive inspector is an advanced proactive hard drive failure detection system that controls 100% of hard-drive risks.\n\nHDDLife is S.M.A.R.T. technology based and works both for single PCs and large computer networks. S.M.A.R.T. technology was developed by hard-drive manufacturers to accurately predict hard-drive life span and prevent HDD malfunction.HDDlife is a software that helps you protect your HDD.\n\nProtect Yourself from Hard Drive Failure\n\nModern hard drives are much more reliable than the disks of yesterday. However, they still are extremely complex electronic devices with moving parts that are subject to amortization. The high density of data storage provided by the modern disks allows for greater storage capacities and higher access speeds. However, with densities and capacities pushed to the extreme you have much more to lose should the drive fail. The hard drive is the most important component in your entire PC because it holds all that is of real value: your documents, digital pictures, email messages, your work and private data.\n\nCan You See the Warning Sign?\n\nLuckily, today&amp;#039;s hard drives rarely fail without a warning given well in advance. All modern disks are equipped with a feature called S.M.A.R.T. that allows real-time analysis and reporting of any developing problems and potential issues. The big question is: can you read the warnings?\n\nWindows? OEM? HDDlife!\n\nMicrosoft Windows, including the new Windows Vista, does not bundle any tools that can access this data. It&amp;#039;s been long ago since hard disk manufacturers offered software with their drives that could warn you of a developing problem; but not anymore.\n\nHDDlife screenshotHDDlife reads S.M.A.R.T. data from all of your hard drives and allows you to see clearly the health and resources of your disks.\n\nNo need for lengthy surface scans! The trademarked JustNow?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½?! technology will detect the health of your drives immediately after you run HDDlife for the very first time.\n\nHHDDlife screenshotDDlife has a highly customizable list of warnings. When your hard drive&amp;#039;s reliability degrades to a certain level, HDDlife will promptly display a warning message. A tool tip near the system clock usually works best, but you can choose among several types of warnings.\n\nAre you a system administrator managing multiple PCs? HDDlife can deliver those warnings by email or over the network.\n\nTune Your Hard Drive Performance\n\nHDDlife is not limited to monitoring your disk&amp;#039;s health. It can cut your power bills by reducing your disk&amp;#039;s power consumption - a truly unique feature which is invaluable if you are managing a number of computers! If your computer sits in a bedroom, you&amp;#039;ll certainly appreciate the ability to easily silence your hard drives by enabling a silent mode without sacrificing too much performance. HDDlife allows you to fine-tune your disk&amp;#039;s noise level and adjust noise vs. performance the way you like.\n\n?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½\nHDDlife will:\n\nControl the health of your hard drives with the S.M.A.R.T. technology and warn you about potential problems the moment they start developing \nMonitor all your hard drives in the background - all the time! \nSupport external USB disks. \nDisplay the drive&amp;#039;s health, temperature, resources and free space. \nDisplay hard disk activities in the system tray, Windows Vista Sidebar and Google Desktop. \n\nForewarned Is Forearmed\n\nBeing aware of a possible hard drive failure gives you the time to take appropriate measures. Back up your data and replace the hard drive - or, better yet, upgrade to a newer, higher capacity model!\n\nFeatures :\n\nEasy to Use\n\nHome users will find HDDlife simple and pleasant to use, while system administrators will appreciate its advanced and powerful features. HDDlife knows everything about your disks and shares its knowledge with you in your favorite way - from seeing the well-being of your hard drives at a glance to getting remote notifications about developing problems over a network.\n\nHard Drive Health Control with S.M.A.R.T.\n\nHDDlife controls the health of your hard drives with the S.M.A.R.T. technology, and warns you about potential problems the moment they start developing. Prevent data loss by discovering a possible hard drive failure before it happens!\n\nContinuous Monitoring and Regular Checkups\n\nHDDlife monitors your hard drive&amp;#039;s health and performance in the background - all the time! You can set your own check-up schedule to prevent performance degradation and untimely warnings.\n\nSee It Right the First Time with JustNow!\n\nHDDlife employs a trademarked unique technology called JustNow! that allows you to see the health and performance of your hard drives immediately when you start HDDlife. JustNow! displays the health and performance figures as a percentage of a brand new disk. No more waiting for a lengthy surface scan! No need to monitor your hard drives for an extended period of time. No competing products can do the same!\n\nProtect Your Backups\n\nHDDlife supports external hard drives connected over USB. You&amp;#039;ll see immediately if your backups are in danger because of a problem developing in an external drive!\n\nSave Power\n\nHDDlife is not limited to monitoring your disk&amp;#039;s health. It can cut your power bills by reducing your disk&amp;#039;s power consumption - a truly unique feature which is invaluable if you are managing a bunch of computers!\n\nHDDlife screenshotControl Noise Levels\n\nDid you know that hard drives have supported the noise control technology for many years without letting you know? The AAM (Automatic Acoustic Management) technology found in all modern hard drives allows adjusting your disk&amp;#039;s noise levels, but there&amp;#039;s no way to access it from Windows - except HDDlife! If your computer sits in a bedroom, you&amp;#039;ll certainly appreciate the ability to easily silence your hard drives by enabling a silent mode without sacrificing too much performance. HDDlife allows you to fine-tune your disk&amp;#039;s noise level and adjust noise vs. performance the way you like.\n\nHDDlife screenshotSee Your Drive&amp;#039;s Health and Performance Anywhere!\n\nHDDlife displays your drive&amp;#039;s health, working temperature, amount of free space, and performance numbers in a convenient manner thanks to just another trademarked technology - AnywhereView. AnywhereView replaces the standard Windows disk icons that you see in My Computer and other Explorer windows, and while opening or saving documents in all Windows programs such as Microsoft Word or even Notepad. Instead of the standard icons, you&amp;#039;ll see the dynamic versions provided by HDDlife that display the health of your disks as a convenient percentage bar. Even if you miss the warnings, you&amp;#039;ll still see the problem when it starts developing.\n\nA Digital Thermometer for Your Hard Drive\n\nHDDlife monitors and displays your drive&amp;#039;s working temperature. Why is this important? Because even a moderate increase in working temperature results in a drastic decline of your drive&amp;#039;s performance. HDDlife shows your drive&amp;#039;s temperatures in the system tray, and will display a warning if the drive overheats.\n\nFree Space Monitor\n\nOne other thing monitored and reported by HDDlife is the free space available on your hard drives. Once there is too little free space on a disk, its performance declines rapidly. With this information handy you&amp;#039;ll be able to free the necessary space and prevent the performance drop.\n\nHDDlife screenshotHow Old Is Your Disk?\n\nBuying a used hard drive can be a gamble. You never know how long it&amp;#039;s been used. HDDlife removes the uncertainty by displaying for you the exact time the hard disk has been used - and that&amp;#039;s on any disk, not just those that were monitored! HDDlife does not need to monitor your hard drives to collect this information. Instead, it reads the use time directly from the drive&amp;#039;s internal memory.\n\nRemote Health and Performance Monitoring for Network Administrators\n\nAre you a system administrator managing multiple PCs? You can easily prevent hard drive failures on all computers in your network. Prevent problems instead of repairing them! HDDlife can deliver warnings on the drive&amp;#039;s health and performance by email or over the network. You will see the pre-failure state of a hard drive, and will have a chance to replace it before it gets out of order. If the performance of a disk declines because of overheating or low free space, you&amp;#039;ll get a warning delivered to you in the most convenient manner.\n\n\n\nPrice : from 70 $\n\nIf you want , you can buy orginal license from :\n\nHDDlife Offical Site\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b57612e10f17d445b58d7d4875f9d59541b146d","amp;dn":"HDDlife+Pro+3.1.157+with+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b57612e10f17d445b58d7d4875f9d59541b146d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,87,97,46,16,241,125,68,91,88,215,212,135,95,157,89,84,27,20,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
