With issue number 10, the bi-monthly magazine changed title to The Hulk Magazine and became a full color book utilizing what they called Marvelcolor.\n\nWith issue 24, the title returned to black and white for the main feature and continued to publish the Dominic Fortune backup story in full color until it&amp;#039;s completion in issue 26. The magazine was retired with issue 27.\n\nThrough the run of the magazine it contained backup features including Bloodstone (issues 1-6, 8) Man-Thing (issue 7) and Shanna the She-Devil (issue 9)\n\nThe Moon Knight was featured in issues 11 -15 , 17-18, and 20 featuring some of Bill Sienkiewicz&amp;#039; early (and best) work where his style was similar to that of Neal Adams.\n\nThanks to the scanners and thank to the varied and original sources including the shiverman who assisted me in completing the series.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.
