In this momentous book, Professor Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr Sebastian Luning demonstrate that the critical cause of global temperature change has been, and continues to be, the sun's activity. Vahrenholt and Luning reveal that four concurrent solar cycles master the earth's temperature Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a climatic reality upon which man's carbon emissions bear little significance. The sun's present cooling phase, precisely monitored in this work, renders the catastrophic prospects put about by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change and the 'green agenda' dominant in contemporary Western politics as nothing less than impossible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d377a0d8f6fa921dca8bc0c9a921ee44c6e49675","amp;dn":"The+Neglected+Sun+by+Fritz+Vahrenholt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d377a0d8f6fa921dca8bc0c9a921ee44c6e49675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,119,160,216,246,250,146,29,202,139,192,201,169,33,238,68,198,228,150,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
