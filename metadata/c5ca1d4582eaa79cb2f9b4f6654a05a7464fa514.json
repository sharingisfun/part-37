Players will wander the African territory and take pictures in order to put together &quot;informative magazine-quality pictorials.&quot; Nabbing the best photo will have to be balanced against drawing too close to the animals. Based on the PC game Wild Earth, the Wii game includes exclusive new features such as a three-player cooperative mode and a Safari mini-game in which gamers can play the animals' perspective using intuitive gestures via the Wii remote.
