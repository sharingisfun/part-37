We actually ended up selling a lot of them.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION FROM THE ALBUM FOLD:\n\n\n&quot;DJ Laserface and MC 0v3rD0s3 are full time superheroes, but decided that sometimes, laying down the phat beats is more important then walkin' the streets.  So they took a hiatus from crime fighting, joined up with The Tastemasters and recorded an album over a period of two weeks locked in their secret hideout with no food or water.  This is that album.\n\nAn intellectual study of racism, bigotry, robot oppression, &amp; vigilantism through the eyes of two of the most prominent names in popular culture, Free Coke is challenging, provocative, and absolutely essential.\n\nFree Coke is structured as two albums, tracks 1-13 &amp; tracks 14-26.  The duality and opposing views coupled with the violent downward trend in quality represent the decline of modern music.  The album is symmetrical in that track 1 should be as enjoyable as track 26 is unpleasant, and so on and so forth.\n\nWe are proud to present Free Coke unedited as it was sent to us by its superhero artists, and take no responsibility for those offended or shocked by its contents.  We are simply passing it on.\n\n- [Names removed]&quot;\n\n\nTRACK LISTING:\n\n\n1. Intro (Laserface Theme)\n2. Electro-Fuck Therapy\n3. Franken-Groove\n4. Electric Frustration\n5. Yeah!\n6.
