This album is considered one of the band&amp;#039;s most raw and edgy work out to date. The main highlight was Raine Maida&amp;#039;s extreme falsetto, and how he could travel between high and low octaves with ease.\n\nFiles ripped using Toast with FLAC 8.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fcda59cb1c7c0ae8938d663ba90c8112d82d551","amp;dn":"Our+Lady+Peace+-+Naveed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fcda59cb1c7c0ae8938d663ba90c8112d82d551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,205,165,156,177,199,192,174,137,56,214,99,186,144,200,17,45,130,213,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
