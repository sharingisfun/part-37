That's a lot of repetition but whether it's taken in either its single-disc or double-disc deluxe editions, The Sound of the Smiths is the best of these posthumous overviews. The single-disc -- which is the first disc of the deluxe set -- is the hits disc, containing every cut from the 18-track 1995 compilation Singles and expanding it with five cuts all dating from the mid-'80s: &quot;Still Ill,&quot; &quot;Nowhere Fast,&quot; &quot;Barbarism Begins at Home,&quot; &quot;The Headmaster Ritual,&quot; and &quot;You Just Haven't Earned It Yet Baby.&quot; As a Smiths-basics goes, it's first-rate, an introduction and summary that's compulsively listenable. The second disc on the deluxe The Sound of the Smiths splits the difference between a rarities compilation and a &quot;more of the best&quot; collection of album tracks, rounding up non-LP singles and B-sides like &quot;Jeane,&quot; &quot;Wonderful Woman,&quot; &quot;Money Changes Everything,&quot; and the New York Vocal version of &quot;This Charming Man,&quot; live versions of &quot;Handsome Devil,&quot; &quot;Meat Is Murder,&quot; &quot;What's the World?&quot; and &quot;London,&quot; the Troy Tate demo of &quot;Pretty Girls Make Graves,&quot; and a bunch of great Smiths songs including a hefty chunk of The Queen Is Dead. It falls short of being the long-awaited collection of Smiths rarities, the absence of which remains a mystery, but it's the best stab at one to date and a pretty entertaining listen in its own right.\n\nArtist...............: The Smiths\nAlbum................: The Sound of The Smiths\nGenre................: Indie/Alternative\nSource...............: CD\nReleased.................:2010\nRipper...............: dBpowerAmp\nQuality..............: MP3 VBRV0 Extreme\nTracklisting\n1\nHand in Glove\n\n2\nThis Charming Man\nJohnny Marr\n\n3\nWhat Difference Does It Make?\n\n4\nStill Ill\n\n5\nHeaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\n\n6\nWilliam, It Was Really Nothing\n\n7\nHow Soon Is Now?\nJohnny Marr / Morrissey\n\n8\nNowhere Fast\n\n9\nShakespeare's Sister\n\n10\nBarbarism Begins at Home [7&quot; Version]\n\n11\nThat Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\n\n12\nThe Headmaster Ritual\n\n13\nThe Boy with the Thorn in His Side\n\n14\nBigmouth Strikes Again\n\n15\nThere Is a Light That Never Goes Out\n18\nYou Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\n\n19\nShoplifters of the World Unite\n\n20\nSheila Take a Bow\n\n21\nGirlfriend in a Coma\n\n22\nI Started Something I Couldn't Finish\n\n23\nLast Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3deeae20bd940bb8e35690238d84ff89e11ea38","amp;dn":"The+Smiths+-+The+Sound+of+the+Smiths+%28Best+of%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3deeae20bd940bb8e35690238d84ff89e11ea38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,222,234,226,11,217,64,187,142,53,105,2,56,216,79,248,158,17,234,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
