A veteran of more than forty years of film-making and exploring the natural world in works like The Monkey People and Microcosmos, Perrin is the public face of an elite group that includes both veterans of Jacques-Yves CousteauÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pioneering exploits and cutting-edge innovators whose custom-created equipment captures never-before-witnessed scenes.\n\nFrom the tropics to Antarctica, from Norway to New Zealand, and from tiny organisms at the bottom of the marine food chain to such magnificent creatures as blue whales, polar bears, swordfish, and giant squid, this vividly illustrated, deeply informative volume roams the seven-tenths of Earth blanketed by oceans that make our blue planet so hospitable to life. \n\nTo capture the images here, divers swam unprotected among great white sharks and patiently staked out the breeding grounds where families of humpback whales sing their distinctive songs. Resourceful crew members created everything from streamlined camera pods able to keep pace with frolicking dolphins to a remote-controlled, mini-helicopter which hovered over a pod of whales to obtain footage impossible otherwise. \n\nPhotographers invented a microscopic lens that revealed and recorded new universes of plankton, algae, coral, and tiny fish eggs--the minute building blocks that nourish this entire intricate, interdependent ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Pierce Brosnan \n===========================\n\n\nDirected by: Jacques Perrin &amp; Jacques Cluzaud \n=============================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Oceans\nYear.................:    2009\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:24:01\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    384 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    2.35:1\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    608x256\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1164 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (External English + Swedish)\nFile Size:...........:    699 MB\nFPS..................:    23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    6 channels\nRelease date.........:    2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765128/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765128/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External ( English + Swedish) included.\n=============================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       \n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s)on\n\nmy older torrents instead,thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n                          \n                          &quot;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD&quot;                  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c5b67f23c452eae10cdee38123c45b8c9ce3f2","amp;dn":"Oceans-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c5b67f23c452eae10cdee38123c45b8c9ce3f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,197,182,127,35,196,82,234,225,12,222,227,129,35,196,91,140,156,227,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
