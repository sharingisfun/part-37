The new songs are said\nto be influenced by minimalistic post-punk,\nkrautrock, repetitive &quot;motorik&quot; beat and ambient\nnoise. We&amp;#039;ll, hopefully, know if that&amp;#039;s true on September 10.\n\nThe Radio Dept. was formed by Elin Almered and\nJohan Duncanson in 1995 who were in the school\ntogether in their early teenage. The name was taken\nfrom a gas station/radio repairer in Lund, Sweden\nwhich had a large sign with the name\n&quot;Radioavdelningen&quot; (The Radio Department in\nSwedish...) hanging outside their shop. Just like\ntoday Elin and Johan hung out with people who, if\nthey didn&amp;#039;t play music, were into photo, film, art\nand the likes. The Radio Deptartment was a suiting\nname as it became a department of it&amp;#039;s own among\ntheir friends&amp;#039; activities.\n\nSince 1995 members has been coming and going and at\nsome points there has never really been a Radio\nDepartment at all. Martin Larsson and Johan\nDuncanson started playing together in 1998 and\ndecided to use the name The Radio Dept. Since then\nthe band has done lots of gigs and lots recordings.\nThe Radio Dept. has recorded on 4-tracks in\nfriends&amp;#039; living rooms or at home, in smelly\nwarehouse, in demo studios with blinking fluorecent\nlightning and at schools. In the autumn of 2001\nLisa Carlberg, bass player and the love of Martin,\nand Per Blomgren, drums, joined the band and they\nstarted rehearsing in the way bands so often do.\nThe latest recordings were sent to the music\nmagazine Sonic and got a nice review. They were\nalso on the free CD sampler that comes with the\nmagazine. That&amp;#039;s where Labrador Records discovered\nand learned to love the band. Now they&amp;#039;re a part of\nSweden&amp;#039;s finest indie label.
