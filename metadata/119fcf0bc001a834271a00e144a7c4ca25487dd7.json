Natural disasters. Domestic crackdowns. Economic collapse. Riots. Wars. Disease. Starvation.\n\nWhat can you do when it all hits the fan?\n\nYou can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system.\n\n**I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestseller The Game, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year.\n\nAfter the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and now of world financial meltdownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Strauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future.\n\nWith the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that marked The Game, The Dirt, and How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergency traces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor. It's a tale of paranoid fantasies and crippling doubts, of shady lawyers and dangerous cult leaders, of billionaire gun nuts and survivalist superheroes, of weirdos, heroes, and ordinary citizens going off the grid.\n\nIt's one man's story of a dangerous worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and how to stay alive in it.\n\nBefore the next disaster strikes, you're going to want to read this book. And you'll want to do everything it suggests. Because tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee... \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Emergency-This-Book-Will-Save/dp/0060898771/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304182704&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Emergency-This-Book-Will-Save/dp/0060898771/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304182704&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:119fcf0bc001a834271a00e144a7c4ca25487dd7","amp;dn":"Emergency%3A+This+Book+Will+Save+Your+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"119fcf0bc001a834271a00e144a7c4ca25487dd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,159,207,11,192,1,168,52,39,26,0,225,68,167,196,202,37,72,125,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
