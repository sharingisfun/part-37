I carried on with\ndoing it for a while longer until I discovered, at the age\nof 20, the side of house music that still fascinates me:\nclub or tribal house.\n\nThe powerful vocals plus the absurd talent of such\nproducers as Thunderpuss, Junior Vasquez, Victor Calderone\nand others really made me disbelieve what I was listening.\n\nFrom that moment I truly found myself. I knew what I\nwanted. That was when I started learning more about the\nclub house genre and improving my musical knowledge. I've\nalways been computer-savvy, which also helped me a lot and\nallowed me to begin all the work you know today.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rafaellelis.com.br/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rafaellelis.com.br/&lt;/a&gt;\n__________________________________________________\n\nncore releases\n38+: http://thepiratebay.se/user/asianmofo\n1-37: http://thepiratebay.se/user/kijyo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae7dd82fdf37f9206b30bf7a8165ba21972bf284","amp;dn":"Britney_Spears-3_%28Rafael_Lelis_Mixes%29-Web_Promo-2009-ncore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae7dd82fdf37f9206b30bf7a8165ba21972bf284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,125,216,47,223,55,249,32,107,48,191,122,129,101,186,33,151,43,242,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
