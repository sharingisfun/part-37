Features of the locomotive include standard and advanced driving controls, with extra scripting on the advanced controls to depict vacuum brakes, dampers, notched reverser, exterior animations and controller emitters. \n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR/LNER Class J50 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Western Lines of Scotland route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nPlease use the email address or the facebook fanpage for requests, questions and also if you want to share an addon with the community which we will post on your behalf.\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please read the Readme.pdf.\n\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fe8a9b9f938a8e9cca9b889b8cbe99939f9792d09d9193&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nA Team tpb_4_ever upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f2351123a8469dc3020418be859530d5ed694dd","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+BR%2FLNER+Class+J50+Loco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f2351123a8469dc3020418be859530d5ed694dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,35,81,18,58,132,105,220,48,32,65,139,232,89,83,13,94,214,148,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
