His previous album Marathon was a focused song-cycle containing deep, often moving songs that perhaps suffered from the lack of aural disparity between the individual songs comprising that recording. No such worry with Love Calling, a mature, substantial, and certainly impactful album with each of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eleven songs standing as sentinels of power, creating a formidable production.\n\nWith more in common with his contemporariesÃ¢â‚¬â€including Kevin Welch, Jimmy LaFave, and collaborator Radney FosterÃ¢â‚¬â€than the previous generation of Texas legendsÃ¢â‚¬â€Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, and even Steve Earle Ã¢â‚¬â€SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songcraft alternates between universal first-person reflections on hopes, dreams, and failings and personal wonder at the magic contained within our lives, homes, and world.\n\nFoster and Smith co-wrote four of the songs, including the emotionally charged Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angel Flight,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song honoring the volunteer pilots who fly home the bodies of fallen comrades, which initially appeared on FosterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Revival album of 2009. With such heavy inspiration, in the hands of lesser writers and singers, the performance could be hackneyed and overwrought. Leading off Love Calling, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angel FlightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is instead honest and true, a revelation of the devotion and commitment we possess when at our best.\n\nIn a different time, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reason to LiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Better NowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (another Foster co-write) would be played on commercial country radio. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Medicine WheelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an impressively executed number, propelled by mandolin from co-producer Jon Randall Stewart, and here SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice (to provide perspective) reminds one of Kieran KaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s: restrained but pure; elsewhere, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Favorite WayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ calls forth Stephen FearingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unhurried and passionately poetic approach to singing.\n\nNashville studio A-listers serve as SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band, including the likes of Michael Rhodes and Byron House (bass), Pat Bergeson (guitars), John Jarvis (keyboards), and Dan Dugmore (pedal steel), as well as Stewart on vocals. Jessi Alexander and Shawn Colvin each provide substantive vocal harmony to a single track.\n\nNo filler here with the haunting Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Smell SmokeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the dark inner conflict of Ã¢â‚¬Å“BaltimoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ late in the set standing equal to the especially powerful, front-loaded songs.\n\nBonuses of Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Say a Little PrayerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a second performance of the titl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e0540188e617950b15efd7c62bece4cbc96bc1b","amp;dn":"Darden+Smith+-+Love+Calling+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e0540188e617950b15efd7c62bece4cbc96bc1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,5,64,24,142,97,121,80,177,94,253,124,98,190,206,76,188,150,188,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
