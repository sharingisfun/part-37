Also included a update patch.\n\nDescription\n\nAnother Perspective is a 2d puzzle platformer following the very confusing adventure of someone who is looking for something but doesn't remember what that something is. \n\nHe discovers he has the power to swap minds with what appears to be other versions of himself who all see the world in different ways. Where one pair of eyes sees a bottomless pit, another might not. \n\nCombining these thoughts and realities leads him to progress - or to at least do something that resembles progress - however this new found ability deeply confuses and concerns him. He is left with the quest of not only finding whatever it was he was looking for, but also of just making some kind of sense out of the world around him. \n\n\nNO CRACK OR ANOTHER TYPE OF TRICK NEEDED, GAME IS DRM-FREE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7be442420681f2529dbda9956dabc00a7b2c079","amp;dn":"Another+Perspective+%2B+Patch+%28DRM+Free%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7be442420681f2529dbda9956dabc00a7b2c079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,190,68,36,32,104,31,37,41,219,218,153,86,218,188,0,167,178,192,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
