But where the former cultivated an anonymous profile common to so many electronic music knob-twiddlers, Zomby was, in a way, dubstep's own version of virtuoso guitarist Buckethead. His first official picture displayed him in ninja clothing, with a cardboard Eye of Providence covering his visage -- an image he joked about procuring from a Google Images search. Nevertheless, his old-school rave-inflected take on dubstep garnered a cult following in electronic music circles, which only increased with the release of his 2008 debut album, Where Were U in 92?. The jittery One Foot Ahead of the Other EP was released the following year. He then signed to 4AD, where he released 2011's melodically rich Dedication.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e6028256583bf81cf385941d99da83375b3b282","amp;dn":"Zomby+-+With+Love+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e6028256583bf81cf385941d99da83375b3b282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,96,40,37,101,131,191,129,207,56,89,65,217,157,168,51,117,179,178,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
