Future heirlooms like family photos, home movies, and personal letters now exist only in digital form, and in many cases they are stored using popular services like Flickr, YouTube, and Gmail. These digital possessions form a rich collection that chronicles our lives and connects us to each other.\n\nBut have you considered what will happen to your treasured digital possessions when you die?\n\nUnfortunately the answer isn't as certain as we might presume. There are numerous legal, cultural, and technical issues that could prevent access to these assets, and if you don't take steps to make them available to your heirs, your digital legacy could be lost forever.\n\nWritten by the creators of TheDigitalBeyond.com, this book helps you secure your valuable digital assets for your loved ones and perhaps posterity. Whether you're the casual email user or the hyper-connected digital dweller, you'll come away with peace of mind knowing that your digital heirlooms won't be lost in the shuffle\n\n\n# Paperback: 216 pages\n# Publisher: New Riders Press; 1 edition (November 25, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321732286\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321732286","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cceb134327ad418661a9fa3ac5a6fbb849fea88","amp;dn":"Your+Digital+Afterlife+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cceb134327ad418661a9fa3ac5a6fbb849fea88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,206,177,52,50,122,212,24,102,26,159,163,172,90,111,187,132,159,234,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
