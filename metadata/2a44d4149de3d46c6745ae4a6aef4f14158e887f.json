In response, the Extermination Act is created, a law that allows anyone who carries a gun to use lethal force in &quot;alien-related&quot; situation. Eventually, the law is extended to allow the killings of humans as well, allowing for the creation of licensed Exterminators. Roachmill - a tall Dirty Harry-era Clint Eastwood look-a-like with two extra cockroach arms extending from his abdomen - is one such Exterminator, willing - for a price - to kill anyone or anything. The stories veered wildly between comedy, satire and serious sci-fi and the art between cartoony and realistic, sometimes in the same issue.\n\nBlackthorne Publishing put out the first six issues of Roachmill before creators Hedden and McWeeney were lured away by Dark Horse Comics. Dark Horse published an additional ten issues before the series was canceled. Roachmill Book 1: Framed and Roachmill Book 2: The Greatest Roachmill Stories Ever Told reprint the Blackthorne stories, and the first Dark Horse story.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a44d4149de3d46c6745ae4a6aef4f14158e887f","amp;dn":"Roachmill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a44d4149de3d46c6745ae4a6aef4f14158e887f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,68,212,20,157,227,212,108,103,69,174,74,106,239,79,20,21,142,136,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
