The U.S. military is powerless against the monsters whose physiology defies all conventional weaponry. The military then responds with the aid of Dr. Azuma, a bio-engineer, to create a genetic hybrid to combat the giant monsters.\n\nNicknamed &quot;Yochu&quot; by Dr. Azuma and known to the military under the operational name &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, humanity's only hope lies in the nine-foot super-being with a bio-engineered arsenal and a samurai katana forged from the fang of one of the behemoths. With a little help from the outlaw Jill Sleet, the only human capable of surviving the poisonous territories of the giants, Jack must learn to overcome or embrace his monstrous nature in order to determine the destiny of mankind.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giantkiller&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giantkiller&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/jack-the-giant-killer/29-71693/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/jack-the-giant-killer/29-71693/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Giant-Killer-Giantkiller-Dan-Brereton/product-reviews/1582405395/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_summary?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Giant-Killer-Giantkiller-Dan-Brereton/product-reviews/1582405395/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_summary?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nGiantkiller - A to Z.cbr 12.5 MB\n\nGiantkiller 01.cbr 14.3 MB\nGiantkiller 02.cbr 9.10 MB\nGiantkiller 03.cbr 9.51 MB\nGiantkiller 04.cbr 10.5 MB\nGiantkiller 05.cbr 10.9 MB\nGiantkiller 06.cbr 9.13 MB\n\nTorrent downloaded from46 B ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a1aa8f441a11d3d15ef2756a28a24e19e860372","amp;dn":"Giantkiller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a1aa8f441a11d3d15ef2756a28a24e19e860372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,26,168,244,65,161,29,61,21,239,39,86,162,138,36,225,158,134,3,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
