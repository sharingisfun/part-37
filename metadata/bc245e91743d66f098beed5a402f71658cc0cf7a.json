In the early '70s, when he appeared with his introspective songs, acoustic guitar, and calm, understated singing style, he mirrored a generation's emotional exhaustion after tumultuous times. Just as Bing Crosby's reassuring voice brought the country out of the Depression and through World War II, Taylor's eased the transition from '60s activism and its attendant frustrations into the less political, more inward-looking '70s. He was rewarded with a series of hit albums and singles (surprisingly, many of the latter were covers of old songs rather than his own compositions), and he managed to survive his initial fame to achieve lasting popularity. He continued to tour successfully for decades, and, starting with his 1970 breakthrough Sweet Baby James, all but one of his regular album releases for the rest of the century went gold or platinum, while his 1976 Greatest Hits album achieved a diamond certification reflecting sales of more than ten million copies. \n\nLegendary singer/songwriter and five-time Grammy Award winning artist James Taylor presents his first collection of original recordings in over 13 years.\n\n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Concord\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect, Cue\n\n\n\n01.Today Today Today\n02.You And I Again\n03.Angels Of Fenway\n04.Stretch Of The Highway\n05.Montana\n06.Watchin' Over Me\n07.SnowTime\n08.Before This WorldJolly Springtime\n09.Far Afghanistan\n10.Wild Mountain Thyme\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc245e91743d66f098beed5a402f71658cc0cf7a","amp;dn":"James+Taylor+-+Before+This+World+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc245e91743d66f098beed5a402f71658cc0cf7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,36,94,145,116,61,102,240,152,190,237,90,64,47,113,101,140,192,207,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
