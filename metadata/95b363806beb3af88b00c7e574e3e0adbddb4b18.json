The one Monk song is the infrequently heard &quot;Played Twice&quot;; they also add a relaxed yet solidly swinging interpretation of the old standard &quot;If I Should Lose You.&quot; Kenny Barron contributed the Latin-flavored &quot;El SueÃƒÂ±o&quot; and the turbocharged &quot;Flight Path.&quot; Tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse (a veteran of nearly 11 years in Monk's quartet) wrote &quot;Pumpkin's Delight,&quot; which is easily the most intricate chart of the session. Bassist Buster Williams penned the ballad &quot;Christina&quot; in honor of his niece. All of the group's members are in top form, with drummer Ben Riley (like Rouse, a veteran of Monk's quartet) solidly anchoring the rhythm section. Also noteworthy are the two photographs on the jacket of the 1978 release; the front cover is a dramatic vintage photo of New York City taken from a high-rise by the well-known Margaret Bourke-White, while the group photo on the back cover takes on some special meaning as the now-destroyed twin towers of the World Trade Center rise high above them in the background. This release is well worth seeking.
