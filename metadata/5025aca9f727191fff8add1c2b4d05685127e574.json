An immediate bestseller, the first printing of forty thousand copies was sold out before publication.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Wolf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Wolf&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLike The Call of the Wild, The Sea Wolf tells the story of a soft, domesticated protagonist, in this novel's case an intellectual man named Humphrey van Weyden, forced to become tough and self-reliant by exposure to cruelty and brutality. The story starts with him onboard a San Francisco ferry, called Martinez, which collides with another ship in the fog and sinks. He is set adrift in the sea, eventually being picked up (&quot;rescued&quot; is not the right word) by Wolf Larsen. Larsen is the captain of the seal-hunting schooner Ghost. Brutal and cynical, yet also highly intelligent and intellectual (though highly biased in his opinions as he was self-taught), he rules over his ship and terrorizes the crew with the aid of his exceptionally great physical strength. Van Weyden adequately describes him as an individualist, a hedonist, and a materialist. As Larsen does not believe in the immortality of the soul, he finds no meaning in his life save survival and pleasure and has come to despise all human life and deny its value. Being interested in someone capable of intellectual disputes, he somewhat takes care of &quot;Hump&quot; while forcing him to become a cabin boy, do menial work, and learn to fight to protect himself from a brutal crew.\n\n\nCast:\nAndrew Wincott \nAnthony Jackson \nBrett Usher \nCharles Millham \nClarence Smith\nDavid Bannerman\nIan Dury \nJack Klaff \nJeffrey Gear \nKerry Shale \nNigel Anthony\nNorman Jones\nPeter Penry-Jones \nRichard Pearce\nSarah Connolly\nScott Farrell\nShelley Thompson\nTerence Edmond\nWilliam Roberts\n\nJack London \n\n\n\nThe Sea Wolf - Part 01 of 04\nThe Sea Wolf - Part 02 of 04\nThe Sea Wolf - Part 03 of 04\nThe Sea Wolf - Part 03 of 04\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 55mn 54s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5025aca9f727191fff8add1c2b4d05685127e574","amp;dn":"Jack+London+-+The+Sea+Wolf+-+Audio+Drama+-+128k+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5025aca9f727191fff8add1c2b4d05685127e574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,37,172,169,247,39,25,31,255,138,221,28,43,77,5,104,81,39,229,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
