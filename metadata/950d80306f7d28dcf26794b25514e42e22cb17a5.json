Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Lou Bloom, a driven young man desperate for work who discovers the high-speed world of L.A. crime journalism. Finding a group of freelance camera crews who film crashes, fires, murder and other mayhem, Lou muscles into the cut-throat, dangerous realm of night crawling, where each police siren wail equals a possible windfall and victims are converted into dollars and cents. Aided by Rene Russo as Nina, a veteran of the blood-sport that is local TV news, Lou blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story.\n\nDirector: Dan Gilroy\n\nWriters: Dan Gilroy\n\nActors: Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Bill Paxton, Riz Ahmed\n\nGenre: Drama","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:950d80306f7d28dcf26794b25514e42e22cb17a5","amp;dn":"Nightcrawler.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"950d80306f7d28dcf26794b25514e42e22cb17a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,13,128,48,111,125,40,220,242,103,148,178,85,20,228,46,34,203,23,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
