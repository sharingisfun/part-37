Financial markets sell \nand buy risk, thereby binding the future. Elena Esposito explains that complex risk \nmanagement techniques of structured finance produce new and uncontrolled risks \nbecause they use a simplified idea of the future, failing to account for how the \nfuture reacts to attempts at controlling it. During the recent financial crisis, \nthe future had already been used (through securitizations, derivatives and other \ntools) to the extent that we had many futures, but no open future available.
