I had heard\nthings from Norwegian percussionist Terje Isungset, but this album really is\nsomething else. Karl Seglem plays sax, ram's horn, voice and electronics. The\ntwo musicians create a kind of music you've never heard before : tribal,\nintense, furious, melodic, mad, frantic, explosive, rhythmic, intimate,\nexpansive, hypnotic, joyful, sad, ... and all that in a very compact format. The\nwhole CD consists of 12 tracks of which only two last longer than 5 minutes. The\nmajor feat of this music is that it is absolutely impossible to classify, yet\nextremely coherent and unique in it's own approach. All pieces are totally\ndifferent, but they all speak the same (new) musical language. It is so utterly\ncreative and at the same time so accessible and avant-garde and\nout-of-this-world that it's hard to compare to anything I know.\n\nAll I can say is : get your copy of it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be5d6493fc12635462316f466e82616b6c02a6d2","amp;dn":"Isglem+-+Fire+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be5d6493fc12635462316f466e82616b6c02a6d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,93,100,147,252,18,99,84,98,49,111,70,110,130,97,107,108,2,166,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
