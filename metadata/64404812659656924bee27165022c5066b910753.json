What would that extraordinary circumstance do to your life?  Writer Joe Casey (Wildcats Version 3.0, X-Men, Superman) and Eisner Award-nominated artist Charlie Adlard (Walking Dead) answer these questions and more in this gut-wrenching original graphic novel drama.  Thomas Dare was an ordinary man with ordinary problems, until fate stepped in to turn his life upside-down. Make no mistake, this is no superhero origin story... Rock Bottom is an epic of human proportions.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64404812659656924bee27165022c5066b910753","amp;dn":"Rock+Bottom+%28AiT%2FPlanet+Lar%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64404812659656924bee27165022c5066b910753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,64,72,18,101,150,86,146,75,238,39,22,80,34,197,6,107,145,7,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
