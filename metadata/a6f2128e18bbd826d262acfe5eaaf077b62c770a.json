Little diamonds of Zen blasted into your mushy brain to pry your eyelids open.&quot; - Tricycle: The Buddhist Review\nNo, this book doesn't advocate suicide - it teaches something that takes a lot more courage: that we are always enlightened, and must take responsibility for realizing our enlightenment. It invites us to meet life on its own terms, wherever we are, whoever we are, right now, killing our false sense of self by seeing through it to our true nature.\nThis is Zen for real life, in the world of relationships, jobs, dirty dishes, teacups and toilets. Zen master Dogo Barry Graham eschews traditional institutions and dogmas and insists instead that we trust in ourselves. Zen is not a system of belief, or a theory about the meaning of life. It is beyond philosophy, beyond religion. It is the gateless gate to freedom from suffering. \n\nAuthor: Dogo Barry Graham\n\nPublisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform\n\nYear released: 17 Sep 2011\n\nGenre: Non fiction\n\nFormat: azw3 &amp; epub\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6f2128e18bbd826d262acfe5eaaf077b62c770a","amp;dn":"Kill+Your+Self+%3A+Life+After+Ego+-+Dogo+Barry+Graham","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6f2128e18bbd826d262acfe5eaaf077b62c770a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,242,18,142,24,187,216,38,210,98,172,254,94,170,240,119,182,44,119,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
