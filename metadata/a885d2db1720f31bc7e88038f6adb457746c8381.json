With the Fourth Edition, the authors continue to innovate by incorporating more ongoing review to help students develop their understanding and study effectively. Mid-chapter Review exercise sets have been added to give students practice in synthesizing the concepts, and new Study Summaries provide built-in tools to help them prepare for tests. The MyMathLab course (access kit required) has been expanded so that the online content is even more integrated with the textÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach, with the addition of Vocabulary, Synthesis, and Mid-chapter Review exercises from the text as well as example-based videos created by the authors.\nAbout the Author\n\nJudy Beecher has an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Indiana University and a graduate degree in mathematics from Purdue University. She has taught at both the high school and college levels with many years of developmental math and precalculus teaching experience at Indiana UniversityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). In addition to her career in textbook publishing, she enjoys traveling, spending time with her grandchildren, and promoting charity projects for a children's camp.\n\n \n\nJudy Penna received her undergraduate degree in mathematics from Kansas State University and her graduate degree in mathematics from the University of Illinois. Since then, she has taught at Indiana UniversityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and at Butler University, and continues to focus on writing quality textbooks for undergraduate mathematics students. In her free time she likes to travel, read, knit and spend time with her children.\n\n \nMarvin Bittinger has been teaching math at the university level for more than thirty-eight years.
