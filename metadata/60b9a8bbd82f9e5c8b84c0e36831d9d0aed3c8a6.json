This long awaited new book is the sequel to the latter. The design and development of the British bomber since World War Two is covered in similar depth and again the emphasis is placed on the tender design competitions between projects from different companies. Extensive reference has been made to recently declassified archives in national and industry collections which allows many little known projects to be brought together within a full narrative of bomber development. The design backgrounds to the V-Bomber programme, Canberra, Buccaneer, Avro 730, TSR.2, Harrier, Jaguar and Tornado are revealed in more detail than has probably ever been published before but attention is also given to anti-submarine types and stillborn programmes such as the RAF's first requirement for a low level bomber and the AFVG. The book includes many previously unpublished illustrations plus specially commissioned artworks of 'might-have-been' types in contemporary markings. Keith Woodcock's cover painting shows how the Avro 698 might have looked in service had it not been turned into the famous Vulcan.\n\nAmazon.co.uk title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/British-Secret-Projects-Bombers-Since/dp/185780130X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/British-Secret-Projects-Bombers-Since/dp/185780130X&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b9a8bbd82f9e5c8b84c0e36831d9d0aed3c8a6","amp;dn":"British+Secret+Projects%3A+Jet+Bombers+Since+1949","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b9a8bbd82f9e5c8b84c0e36831d9d0aed3c8a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,185,168,187,216,47,158,92,139,132,192,227,104,49,217,208,174,211,200,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
