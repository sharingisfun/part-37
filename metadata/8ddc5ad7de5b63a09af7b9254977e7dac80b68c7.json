One of them holds all the power before somebody is eliminated.\n\n\n\nEpisode 9\n\nThis challenge will leave our contestants feeling sky-high, and maybe a little dizzy, as they're introduced to the ride of their life in Aeroplane at an airfield near Geelong. The contestants meet at the iconic Luna Park in St Kilda where a game of 'Spot The Difference' highlights how important attention to detail is in The Mole. To round off the two weeks in Melbourne the contestants meet Shura at Flemington Racecourse for a Quiz and Termination. With the Melbourne Cup shimmering in front of them, each contestant will be hoping they avoid a red screen as nine contestants become eight.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 24-Jul-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ddc5ad7de5b63a09af7b9254977e7dac80b68c7","amp;dn":"The.Mole.AU.S06E08-E09.HDTV.x264-NoGRP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ddc5ad7de5b63a09af7b9254977e7dac80b68c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,220,90,215,222,91,99,160,154,247,185,37,73,119,231,218,200,11,104,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
