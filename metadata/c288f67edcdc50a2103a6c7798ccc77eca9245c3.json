We have become so accustomed to them that they have faded into oblivion, or are covered up by manmade noises. By attending to nature sounds, we lift them back up into our awareness and allow them to have a harmonizing effect on our organism. And, since nature's music has no beginning or end, it easily creates a sense of timelessness.\n\n&quot;The task of art is to prepare the senses for never-ending delight and wonder and to reconcile man with surrounding rality&quot; --Vermeer (painter)\n\n  From Amazon.com:\nDeuter is a seminal new age musician, active for over 30 years (60+ albums). Also a Reiki practitioner, he lives and works in the mountains of Santa Fe, creating the contemplative, healing music for which he has become renowned. Through feeling, awareness, and experience, constantly inspired by the natural world around him, Deuter creates music that transports the listener to a place of peacefulness and well-being. He continues to earn and master an ever-expanding array of instruments including the drums, shakuhachi, cello, koto, sitar, Tibetan singing bowls, santoor, bouzouki, and keyboards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c288f67edcdc50a2103a6c7798ccc77eca9245c3","amp;dn":"NOTES+FROM+A+PLANET+-+Deuter.+%28Nature%2C+New+Age%29+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c288f67edcdc50a2103a6c7798ccc77eca9245c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,136,246,126,220,220,80,162,16,58,108,119,152,204,199,126,202,146,69,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
