Hard hitting is not the way i would describe this film , in fact ,the way they film is portrayed is as if going straight and getting off the drugs is least attractive and rewarding. Apart from the death of the young girl (Heather Graham) the scenes where the group of junkies take the drugs are hardly ground breaking or even interesting. So what is the story trying to tell us? Perhaps it is that drugs can affect anybody of any age and that luck or superstition has nothing to do with card's that we are dealt in life. Matt Dillon's acting is good as usual which is more than can be said for all the actors.John Kelly who played the cop was dire. If you want to see a really good film on addiction watch Trainspotting or leaving Las Vegas and give this one a miss. 5 out of 10.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59113d295c61d8b6361a50a3cae8e868c9ec502c","amp;dn":"Drugstore+cowboy+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59113d295c61d8b6361a50a3cae8e868c9ec502c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,17,61,41,92,97,216,182,54,26,80,163,202,232,232,104,201,236,80,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
