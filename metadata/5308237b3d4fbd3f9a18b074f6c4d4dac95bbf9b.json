Paglia describes herself as an atheist who defends religion, explaining that an understanding of world religions and their symbols is essential to fully understanding human civilization and our place in the universe. She also devotes part of her lecture to Hollywood and how it has dealt with religious themes throughout its history, culminating with an entertaining critique of Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 53mn 11s 736ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 088 Kbps\nAspect            : 544 x 400 (1.360) at 29.970 fps\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubttles          : None\nGenre             : Educational\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 121 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5308237b3d4fbd3f9a18b074f6c4d4dac95bbf9b","amp;dn":"tvo+Big+Ideas.Camille+Paglia.Jan+03%2C2010.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5308237b3d4fbd3f9a18b074f6c4d4dac95bbf9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,8,35,123,61,79,189,63,154,24,176,116,246,196,212,218,201,91,191,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
