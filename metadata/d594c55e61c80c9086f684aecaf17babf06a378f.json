She appeared out of nowhere, in the middle of traffic, on a busy day. A teenager with no past, no family - no memories.\n\nSuch a lovely child....\n\nSo blond and beautiful. Carol and Paul were drawn to her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ she was the child theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d never had. A dream come true. And then CarolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nightmares began ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the ghastly sounds in the nightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the bloody face in the mirrorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the razor-sharp ax.\n\nSuch a relentless evil....\n\nSo deceptively innocent. Most mothers would die for such a darling little angel. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what frightened Carol most of all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d594c55e61c80c9086f684aecaf17babf06a378f","amp;dn":"Dean+Koontz+-+The+Mask+%28Unabridged%29+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d594c55e61c80c9086f684aecaf17babf06a378f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,148,197,94,97,200,12,144,134,246,132,174,202,241,123,171,240,106,55,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
