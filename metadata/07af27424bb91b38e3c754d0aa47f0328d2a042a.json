It encompasses the 98 years of Chagallâ€™s life (1887-1985) in Russia, France, the US, as well as Germany and Israel, his deep roots in folk culture, his personal relationships and loves, his involvement with the art of the Russian Revolution, with Surrealism, Communism, Zionism, Yiddish literature and the state of Israel. The book exposes the complex relationships between Chagallâ€™s three cultural identities: Jewish-Russian-French. Indeed, it is a biography of the turbulent times of the twentieth century and the transformations of a Jew in it, his meteoric rise from the â€œghettoâ€ of the Russian Pale of Settlement to the centers of modern culture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07af27424bb91b38e3c754d0aa47f0328d2a042a","amp;dn":"Marc+Chagall+and+His+Times+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07af27424bb91b38e3c754d0aa47f0328d2a042a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,175,39,66,75,185,27,56,227,199,84,208,170,71,240,50,141,42,4,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
