Greene on The Gospel Hour Radio Program.\n\nOliver Boyce Greene (February 14, 1915 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ July 26, 1976) was an Independent Fundamental Baptist evangelist and author. He converted in 1935 at the age of 20. Over 200,000 confessions of faith were recorded as a result of his ministry.[1] Although uneducated with little training, he conducted revival meetings in tents and in churches across the eastern US for 35 years, and wrote over 100 books and brief booklets about the Bible. One of Oliver B. Greene\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s most distinguishing characteristics was his deep, raspy voice, which drew radio listeners into his message.\n\nIn 1956, he founded The Gospel Hour, Inc. as a Christian outreach ministry. It included a radio program of his preaching called The Gospel Hour, which began on one station in Georgia and gradually became syndicated until the point it spanned the nation. The Gospel Hour was heard on 150 stations at the time of his death. The cause of death was a cardiac aneurysm. The broadcast is currently on over 80 stations, including international stations and the Internet. Taped copies of the program are still aired today on the Fundamental Broadcasting Network and other Christian radio stations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c266def52c01ab983ffc66b8eaedde4c9a0bc11e","amp;dn":"Oliver+Greene+-+Rightly+Dividing+the+Word","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c266def52c01ab983ffc66b8eaedde4c9a0bc11e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,102,222,245,44,1,171,152,63,252,102,184,234,237,222,76,154,11,193,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
