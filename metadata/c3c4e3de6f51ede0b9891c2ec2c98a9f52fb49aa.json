With over a million men under arms throughout central Europe, Coalition forces poured over the Rhine River to invade France between late November 1813 and early January 1814. Three principle army groups drove across the great German landmark, smashing the exhausted French forces that attempted to defend the eastern frontier. In less than a month, French forces ingloriously retreated from the Rhine to the Marne; Allied forces were within one week of reaching Paris. This book provides the first complete, English-language study of the invasion of France along a front that extended from Holland to Switzerland. \n\n700 pp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3c4e3de6f51ede0b9891c2ec2c98a9f52fb49aa","amp;dn":"The+Fall+of+Napoleon%3A+Volume+1+%282007%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3c4e3de6f51ede0b9891c2ec2c98a9f52fb49aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,196,227,222,111,81,237,224,185,137,28,46,194,201,138,159,82,251,73,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
