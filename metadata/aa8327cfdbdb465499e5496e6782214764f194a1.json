It is published in France by Les HumanoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯des AssociÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s and reprinted in North America by Devil's Due. \n\nIn a world where humans have to live with the living dead, a new job opportunity is born: zombie catcher. Karl Neard, his sister Maggie and his Belgian friend Freddy Merckx embrace this career in hopes of making easy money. Unfortunately, the job isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t that simple: not only are zombieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dead bodies walking, but they also have a terrible scent and an awful sense of humor. As a matter of fact, zombies just donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t care about anything, for their lives are behind them and they have an eternity to enjoy. This is how Karl and his team end up attracting all sorts of freaks in 2064 Los Angeles.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa8327cfdbdb465499e5496e6782214764f194a1","amp;dn":"The+Zombies+That+Ate+The+World+%28DDP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa8327cfdbdb465499e5496e6782214764f194a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,131,39,207,219,219,70,84,153,229,73,110,103,130,33,71,100,241,148,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
