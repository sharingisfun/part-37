But the Arbor, HeartwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s holy tree, is failing, and because the land and its people are one, it is imperative the nations try to make peace.\n\nAfter the Veriditas, or annual Greening Ceremony, the Congressus takes place. The talks do not go well and tempers are rising when an army of warriors emerges from the river. After a fierce battle, the Heartwood knights discover that the water warriors have stolen the ArborÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart. For the first time in history, its leaves begin to fall...\n\nThe knights divide into seven groups and begin an epic quest to retrieve the Arbor, and save the land\n\n\n#2 SUNSTONE\n\nThe Incendi elementals that dwell beneath the mountains have found a way to tap into the ArborÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots, which stretch not only across the land but also through time, and King Pyra is determined to crush the ancient tree.\n\nTwenty-two years after the defeat of the Darkwater Lords, ChonradÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow Procella and their three children are drawn back to Heartwood to investigate the rumour of strange fires springing up across the land. Across three separate timelines, the heroes must battle to join together their ancient sunstones, to overcome the Incendi threat, and to protect the Arbor and make earth victorious once more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88f24f0b3f0870e3f69ad19aa4068dc049599fa4","amp;dn":"The+Elemental+Wars+%28Books+I+%26amp%3B+II%29+by+Freya+Robertson+%28EPUB+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88f24f0b3f0870e3f69ad19aa4068dc049599fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,242,79,11,63,8,112,227,246,154,209,154,164,6,141,192,73,89,159,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
