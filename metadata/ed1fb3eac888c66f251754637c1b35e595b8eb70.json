In the spotlight are such instrumental heavyweights as Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Eddie Harris, Charles Mingus, Hank Crawford, and Yusef Lateef, and on the vocal end there&amp;#039;s fine work by Betty Carter and Mose Allison. Yes, this album might have a tough time competing with similar collections from the Blue Note and Impulse! imprints. But then again, those labels would be hard-pressed to come up with a selection as varied as this: From the truly idiosyncratic Ellington musings of Kirk (&quot;Creole Love Call&quot;) to a taste of Aquarius age jazz by Charles Lloyd (&quot;Dreamweaver: Meditation/Dervish Dance&quot;), this 14-track disc truly runs the &amp;#039;60s jazz gamut.
