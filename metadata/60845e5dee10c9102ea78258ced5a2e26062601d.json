It is a dark album, showing that Mr. Springsteen's priority was all about the music, and not just riding the successful coattails of Born To Run. To stay within the theme of what Springsteen was trying to convey, he gave away two additional, more upbeat songs that became huge hits for others, giving &quot;Fire&quot; to The Pointer Sisters and &quot;Because The Night&quot; to Patti Smith.\nIt's a solid effort from start to finish, kicking off with the majestic &quot;Badlands&quot;, one of Springsteen's finest guitar moments with &quot;Adam Raised A Cain&quot;, my personal favorite &quot;Racing In The Street&quot;, and the heartfelt story about the dire life of holding a dead-end job with &quot;Factory&quot;. The title track finishes what was probably the most iconic album of the late 70's. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 80\nArtist: Bruce Springsteen\nAlbum: Darkness on the Edge of Town\nYear: 1978\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60845e5dee10c9102ea78258ced5a2e26062601d","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Darkness+on+the+Edge+of+Town+%5BFLAC-1978%5D%5Btrf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60845e5dee10c9102ea78258ced5a2e26062601d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,132,94,93,238,16,201,16,46,167,130,88,206,213,162,226,96,98,96,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
