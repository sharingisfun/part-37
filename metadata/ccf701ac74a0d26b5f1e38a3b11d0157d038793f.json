It centers on the adventures of an eight-year-old girl named Angela who lives in the fictional town of Tapwater Springs, has wacky brothers, weird friends, and hates a snobbish faux-French girl named Nanette Manoir.[1]\n\nAngela Anaconda began as a short skit on the Nickelodeon show Kablam!. Angela Anaconda later became a series and was aired on Fox Family from 1999 to 2002. In 2001, when Disney bought the Fox Family Channel and changed the network's name to ABC Family, Angela was moved and canceled after two months. The show aired reruns on Nickelodeon in 2004 only to be removed about a month later.\n\nThe show was created by Joanna Ferrone and Sue Rose, who also created the cartoon character Fido Dido. Sue Rose created Disney's Pepper Ann and Nickelodeon's Unfabulous. The show was produced by DHX Media and C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures. It also airs on Teletoon in Canada. It premiered in the UK on Cartoon Network, and also aired there on PopGirl; it also airs on POP TV in Slovenia and ABC2 in Australia. Sue Rose also voices the title character.[2]\n\nThe show features a very distinct art style, reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's animation from Monty Python's Flying Circus, in which all the characters are made out of cutouts of black-and-white photographs.\n\nThe show now airs on Starz Kids &amp; Family. There there are currently no plans for a DVD release of the full series, though in the UK, Channel 4 released three separate DVDs containing in total the first 20 episodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf701ac74a0d26b5f1e38a3b11d0157d038793f","amp;dn":"ANGELA+ANACONDA+%5BCOMPLETE%5BVERIFIED-VIDZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf701ac74a0d26b5f1e38a3b11d0157d038793f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,247,1,172,116,160,210,107,95,30,56,163,177,29,1,87,208,56,121,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
