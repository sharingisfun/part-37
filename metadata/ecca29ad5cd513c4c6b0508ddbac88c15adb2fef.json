He was hospitalized after the recording of Death, Pierce Me. He escaped from the psychiatric ward leaving a note saying &quot;I will kill girls and be as famous as Thomas Quick&quot;. The band later disbanded after Nattramn (Lead vocalist) randomly ran up and attacked a 6 year old girl with an ax and attempting to commit suicide by cop by screaming &quot;Kill Me!&quot; to the police while holding the ax. The police caught him by sneaking up on him while attack dogs distracted him and was sent to a mental hospital. While in the mental hospital he was allowed to make music as a type of therapy. He was not allowed access to drums and guitars but he was allowed a synthesizer. He created a band called Diagnose: Lebensgefahr which is an atmospheric black metal band which will soon be uploaded by me.\n\n\nAlbums\n\nDeath, Pierce Me\n\n\nDemos\n\nDeath, Pierce Me\n\n\n\nEnjoy And Please Do Seed.\n\nSeeding (Weekdays)- 3:00PM-6:00PM   (Weekends)- 10:00AM-10:00PM   (((Hawaii Time)))\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecca29ad5cd513c4c6b0508ddbac88c15adb2fef","amp;dn":"Silencer+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecca29ad5cd513c4c6b0508ddbac88c15adb2fef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,202,41,173,92,213,19,196,198,176,80,141,219,172,136,193,90,219,47,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
