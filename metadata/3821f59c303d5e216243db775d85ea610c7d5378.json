The music on the album is edited together from various live broadcasts that the band had broadcast to radio stations all over the world using ISDN, which at the time was a relatively new technology.\n\nStylistically, the record features some of the ambient of their previous work, but brings in elements of hip-hop, trip-hop and acid jazz.1\n\nThe two released versions have different track listings and cover art. The limited edition, a 10,000-copy pressing released in December 1994, has a black cover. The later release, which first appeared in June 1995, has a white cover with black writing, and a different track listing.\n\nThe album contains numerous references to several films such as Repo Man in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEyes Pop ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Skin Explodes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Everybody DeadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a line spoken by the character J. Frank Parnell, and the track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s My Mind That WorksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ samples Miller saying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyou know how everybodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s into weirdness right nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all part of a cosmic unconsciousness.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ There are also a samples from the sci-fi epic movie Aliens in the track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Far Out Son Of A Lung And The Ramblings Of A MadmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, along with robotic sounds and laser-fire from the film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Black HoleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust a Fuckin IdiotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and samples from films Escape From New York, Predator and The Exorcist II scattered throughout the record.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3821f59c303d5e216243db775d85ea610c7d5378","amp;dn":"FSOL+-+ISDN+%28Black+Edition%29+%281994%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3821f59c303d5e216243db775d85ea610c7d5378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,33,245,156,48,61,94,33,98,67,219,119,93,133,234,97,12,125,83,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
