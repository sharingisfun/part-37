And &quot;The Power of Positive Drinking&quot; is amusing, but rather surprising coming from a guy who would give up alcohol and drugs a year after this was released. \r\n\r\nGrowing Up in Public didn't get much notice on its initial release, but all these years later it sounds like a dry run for what was to be the most creatively fruitful period of Lou Reed's solo career.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
