ASTARTE: Naked Hands (5:13)\n2. BANNERWAR: Unchaining The Wolf (7:15)\n3. DARKTHULE: In The Sight Of Dawn (6:35)\n4. DRAUGLUIN: Arrival (3:01)\n5. FAETHON: Pan, Lord Of The Woods (5:21)\n6. KAWIR: Cosmic Verve (8:51)\n7. LLOTH: In The Weep Of The Ocean (6:17)\n8. ORDER OF THE EBON HAND: To Alloces (6:34)\n9. URANUS: Songs &amp; Dances Of Death (7:35)\n\n\nI must advertise a serious issue: Bannerwar and Darkthule are two of the most famous NSBM scene bands worldwide. I have to remember all people, this blog is not a political blog. Consequently, these bands are in the compilation exclusively for musical reasons, never political. I not support in any form this kind of bands!!\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab7486ccb7f71425731d05da15d66d884a2c0bb5","amp;dn":"Pagan+Dreams+Compilation+VI+-+Hellenic+Heathen+Chants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab7486ccb7f71425731d05da15d66d884a2c0bb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,116,134,204,183,247,20,37,115,29,5,218,21,214,109,136,74,44,11,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
