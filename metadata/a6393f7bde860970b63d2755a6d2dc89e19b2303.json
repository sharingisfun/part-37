Dominated and shaped by a highly intelligent but frustrated and ambitious father, his story sees the development of a unique genius, from precocious and often endearing childhood to liberated fulfillment, unexpected poverty, and a tragically early death. \n\nGenerously illustrated by Mozart's music, from his fifth to his final year, this portrait-in-sound reveals a fascinating yet elusive character, drawing richly on the words of the composer himself and those who knew him. \n\nThis is the ideal way to understand more about Mozart the man, and his music. Throughout his life, he wrote numerous letters to his father and his friends and pupils and his musical colleagues wrote about him. \n\nOn this entertaining recording, with parts read by various actors, Mozart himself comes to life with his sublime music ever-present as his career unfolds.\n\n\nI have set the bitrate higher than I normally do just for speech due to the extensive musical examples presented here. \n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6393f7bde860970b63d2755a6d2dc89e19b2303","amp;dn":"The+Life+and+Work+of+Mozart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6393f7bde860970b63d2755a6d2dc89e19b2303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,57,63,123,222,134,9,112,182,61,39,85,166,210,220,137,225,155,35,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
