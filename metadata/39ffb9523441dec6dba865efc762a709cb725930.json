But the elusive beauty is more suspicious- and in far more danger- than he expected. Pepper has spent years dodging the corrupt club owner who will stop at nothing to keep her silenced. She can trust no one, not even the handsome new Ã¢â‚¬Ëœconstruction workerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moved in next door. The heat between them is undeniable. But will surrendering to passion bring her the safety she so desires- or will her feelings for Logan draw them both into a killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crosshairs?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ffb9523441dec6dba865efc762a709cb725930","amp;dn":"Lori++Foster-Run+the+Risk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39ffb9523441dec6dba865efc762a709cb725930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,255,185,82,52,65,222,198,219,168,101,239,199,98,167,9,203,114,89,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
