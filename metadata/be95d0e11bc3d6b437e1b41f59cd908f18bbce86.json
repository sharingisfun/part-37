Meat Puppets never had the dedicated following of HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼ or the Minutemen -- two fellow SST bands who played the same circuit as the Puppets -- but they were able to carve out a long career where other hardcore bands could not, because they always drew from conventional hard rock as well as punk. Not only did they play hard, loud, and fast, but they also had elements of the blues-rock of ZZ Top, the ambling folk-rock of the Grateful Dead, and Neil Young's country-rock and hard rock. As they grew older, the band matured musically, developing an accomplished instrumental technique and moving closer to the traditional hard rock that was always underneath their punk. But they never quite abandoned their punk roots, even when they briefly broke into the mainstream in the early '90s. \n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tMegaforce\nCatalog:\t\tMEGA1341\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Rat Farm\n02.One More Drop\n03.Down\n04.Leave Your Head Alone\n05.Again\n06.You Don't Know\n07.Waiting\n08.Time And Money\n09.Sometimes Blue\n10.Original One\n11.River Rose\n12.Sweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be95d0e11bc3d6b437e1b41f59cd908f18bbce86","amp;dn":"Meat+Puppets+-+Rat+Farm+%282013%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be95d0e11bc3d6b437e1b41f59cd908f18bbce86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,149,208,225,27,195,214,180,55,225,180,31,89,205,144,143,24,187,206,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
