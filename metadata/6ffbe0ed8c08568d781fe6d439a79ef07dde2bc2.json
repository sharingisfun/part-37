This torrent includes a rip of the DVD, and a scanned version of the letter which was sent along with the DVD. Quite frankly, the entire thing is freaking hilarious. It has convinced me never to participate in the violation of intellectual property laws ever again. Right after this torrent.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nphrackingtoast","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ffbe0ed8c08568d781fe6d439a79ef07dde2bc2","amp;dn":"RIAA+Training+Video%3A+Prosecution+of+Music+Piracy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ffbe0ed8c08568d781fe6d439a79ef07dde2bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,251,224,237,140,8,86,141,120,31,230,212,57,167,158,240,125,222,43,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
