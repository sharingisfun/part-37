However, this album is more riff orientated and slightly darker than Showbiz, containing several songs which use piano or organ. Origin of Symmetry was intended as a more progressive rock-styled album, with different vocal styles than that of Showbiz. The ambition behind the album was to show the harder rock and eccentric elements of the band, that they felt had not been seen so far. This included bringing back a lot of music &quot;filtered out&quot; from Showbiz. The bass in the album is also more prominent and distorted. Some of the songs of the album draw influence from the band members' relationships suffering from the effects of them being on tour. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musewiki.org/Origin_of_Symmetry_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musewiki.org/Origin_of_Symmetry_(album)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cdbb515f3cf32d3286a37cbe6d9618e01a55d8a","amp;dn":"MUSE+-+2001+-+Origin+Of+Symmetry+-+mp3+-+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cdbb515f3cf32d3286a37cbe6d9618e01a55d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,219,181,21,243,207,50,211,40,106,55,203,230,217,97,142,1,165,93,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
