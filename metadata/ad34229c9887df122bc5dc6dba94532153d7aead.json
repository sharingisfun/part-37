The musicianship imprinted in these songs is well crafted. Akira Yamaoka and Joe Romersa are great talented musicians and composers.  Also in these songs is the beautiful and powerful voice of Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, an awesome anime voice actress and fabulous singer; great voice, great talent. Not to forget that Joe Romersa lends his deep, soulful voice on Hometown and Cradel of Forrest and is responsible for the creation of the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics. Joe is a genius when it comes to writing songs. Cradel of Forrest has become a staple all over the net and is a fan favorite as well. Devoted Silent Hill fans will find this compilation of songs a must have. The MP3 files have cover art embedded, will look great on iTunes, Windows Media Player and Zune.  \nCourtesy of Mr. Ivan Pastoriza         \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad34229c9887df122bc5dc6dba94532153d7aead","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Silent+Hill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad34229c9887df122bc5dc6dba94532153d7aead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,52,34,156,152,135,223,18,43,197,220,109,186,148,83,33,83,215,174,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
