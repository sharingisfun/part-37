A late spring and plummeting gold prices push miners to battle frozen ground and sluice harder than ever. Karl races to get 100 ounces in the first week, defying dad Marty, in a bid to prove heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ready to take over the family mine and stake his own claim. KenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s redline operation is jeopardized when junior miner Matt destroys key gear, forcing the boss to decide if the eager but careless hand is worth the cost. Big AlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gamble to strip muddy ground to keep sluicing is a bust when he has to replace big iron without a big payday.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a09cbb6fc39f2cb3d1db11cd68d50c634565612","amp;dn":"YUKON_GOLD_2x01_Behind_The_Eight_Ball.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a09cbb6fc39f2cb3d1db11cd68d50c634565612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,9,203,182,252,57,242,203,61,29,177,28,214,141,80,198,52,86,86,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
