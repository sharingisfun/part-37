Spectacle makers found that a certain combination of lenses made distant objects appear closer. Galileo Galilei made a telescope of his own and looked at the stars with it. And what he found changed the way mankind thought about Nature.\nSince then astronomers have built bigger and better telescopes, to view the universe in ways never thought possible before, in different 'colours' of light, visible, infrared, radio, X-ray and so on, and even with the help of particles. Now they are even building telescopes to detect waves in space-time.\nThis book chronicles the history of telescopes in easy language and with many illustrations. It explains what drives astronomers to build big telescopes, how engineers help them with technological innovations and how the findings with these telescopes have enriched our mind.\n\nThe year 2009 has been declared as the International Year of Astronomy (IYA-2009) coinciding with the 400th anniversary of the first astronomical observations with a telescope by Galileo Galilei and the publication of Johannes KeplerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Astronomia nova (New Astronomy). The central theme of the IYA-2009 is Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Universe Yours to Discover.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The IYA-2009 aims to help people realize how astronomy has enriched almost every human culture and rediscover their place in the Universe through the day and night time sky, and thereby engage a personal sense of wonder and discovery.\n\nAbout the Author\nBiman Nath is an astrophysicist at the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore. He received his PhD in astronomy from the University of Maryland, USA, and he does research on cosmology and the evolution of galaxies. He has written several popular science articles - and books.\n\nCONTENTS\nForeword .......................................................................... vii\n1.
