As far as I know, it is free to distribute.\n\nI simply uploaded the unzipped HTML files. The entire guidebook is there. The HTML File titled &quot;ADOM Guidebook&quot; is the main directory page shortcut. You should use that to navigate.\n\nIf you don&amp;#039;t know what ADOM is, check it out - www.adom.de","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3346994fd87998fefa6c4e93c9207b6fd7bb4324","amp;dn":"Andy+William%5C%27s+ADOM+Guidebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3346994fd87998fefa6c4e93c9207b6fd7bb4324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,70,153,79,216,121,152,254,250,108,78,147,201,32,123,111,215,187,67,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
