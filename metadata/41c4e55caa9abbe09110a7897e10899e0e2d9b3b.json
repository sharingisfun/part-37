Rather than simply cram the thing with trendy indie\ndance tracks and stick their name on it, the boys carefully\nthought-out and impeccably executed mix of squelchy, glitchy\nnew rave tracks. Their newest compilation, FabricLive.41\n(Fabric/Inertia), is equally intriguing and well thought-out,\nonly this time, their focus is on techno. An early highlight\nis the Serge Santiago remix of Hercules &amp; Love AffairÃƒâ€ s Blind,\nwhich stretches the original out, taking its old-school disco\ngrooves to a far more slick, ice place. The messed-up, blippy\nelectro disco thing continues for a few more tracks, taking in\nDiscodeineÃƒâ€ s Joystick and Shit RobotÃƒâ€ s Chasm, until, towards\nthe middle, Moon DogÃƒâ€ s strange, jaunty instrumental Suite\nEquestria kicks in. From here, things get a little louder, and\nthe squelchy, distorted sound of Simian Mobile DiscoÃƒâ€ s\noriginals starts to come through on on Jelo &amp; DeadMau5Ãƒâ€ s The\nReward Is Cheese and the Simon Baker remix of the groupÃƒâ€ s own\nSleep Deprivation. Things get a little more old school after\nthat, as the set moves on to Woolford &amp; PeruÃƒâ€ s Eritoc\nDiscourse and Green VelvetÃƒâ€ s classic Flash, before closing\nwith the wonky, not-quite-Duran Duran of The Walker BrothersÃƒâ€ \nNight Flights. As their DJ skills continue to improve, one can\nonly wonder what the next lot of Simian Mobile Disco album\ntracks will sound like.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41c4e55caa9abbe09110a7897e10899e0e2d9b3b","amp;dn":"VA-Fabriclive.41_%28Mixed_By_Simian_Mobile_Disco%29-%28Advance%29-2008-D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41c4e55caa9abbe09110a7897e10899e0e2d9b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,196,229,92,170,154,187,224,145,16,167,137,126,16,137,158,14,45,155,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
