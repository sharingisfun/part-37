Middle-aged cultural worker Anita Sondore feels that the song lyrics of the young poet CÃ„â€œzars KalniÃ…â€ Ã…Â¡, as sung by a youth ensemble, are inappropriate. She writes a letter of complaint to the newspaper, thus setting in motion the system of censorship.\n\nAfter the film Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a sensitive and emotional portrayal of the spirit of 1960s youth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was finished, it was approved by the Riga Film Studio. However, complications arose when it was handed into the Soviet State Cinematography Committee. R. KalniÃ…â€ Ã…Â¡Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ dissection of the arts censorship system turned out to be too on point, and therefore Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unforgivable. The film was banned from being shown and Ã¢â‚¬Å“shelvedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The first time it was screened to the public was in 1986, when the songs Imants KalniÃ…â€ Ã…Â¡ had composed for the film had already achieved cult status.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:835b1aacbf4eef07091b41f451d33df96cbe0628","amp;dn":"%C4%8Cetri+balti+krekli+%2F+Four+White+Shirts+%281967%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"835b1aacbf4eef07091b41f451d33df96cbe0628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,91,26,172,191,78,239,7,9,27,65,244,81,211,61,249,108,190,6,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
