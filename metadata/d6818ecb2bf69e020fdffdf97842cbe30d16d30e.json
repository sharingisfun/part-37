In this course, explore options that range from personal desktop databases to large-scale geographically distributed database servers and classic relational databases to modern document-oriented systems and data warehousesÃ¢â‚¬â€and learn how to choose the best solution for you. Author Simon Allardice covers key terminology and concepts, such as normalization, &quot;deadly embraces&quot; and &quot;dirty reads,&quot; ACID and CRUD, referential integrity, deadlocks, and rollbacks. The course also explores data modeling step by step through hands-on examples to design the best system for our data. Plus, learn to juggle the competing demands of storage, access, performance, and securityÃ¢â‚¬â€management tasks that are critical to your database's success.\n\nContent:\n\n* What is a database?\n* Why do you need a database?\n* Choosing primary keys\n* Identifying columns and selecting data types\n* Defining relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many\n* Understanding normalization\n* Creating queries to create, insert, update, and delete data\n* Understanding indexing and stored procedures\n* Exploring your data\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6818ecb2bf69e020fdffdf97842cbe30d16d30e","amp;dn":"Foundations+of+Programming+Databases","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6818ecb2bf69e020fdffdf97842cbe30d16d30e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,129,142,203,43,246,158,2,15,223,253,249,120,66,203,227,13,22,211,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
