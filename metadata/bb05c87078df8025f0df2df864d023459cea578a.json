He awakens in a timeline vastly different from the original. Citizen Cold is now the hero of Central City, his Mother is alive, his Father has died of a heart attack and the Justice League does not exist.\n\nMeanwhile in Gotham City a now more violent Batman , who uses guns and lethal force, catches a criminal known as Yo-Yo and demands to know where Joker is. Batman throws Yo-Yo off the building but she is caught by Cyborg, who is now a government agent, before she hits the ground. Batman, Cyborg and a few other heroes via hologram discuss the situation in Europe. Aquaman and the Atlanteans have sunk most of Western Europe apart from Great Britain which was conquered by the Amazons and Christened 'New Themyscira'.\n\nBarry drives to Wayne Manor and enters the Batcave where Batman attacks him. The Batman of this Universe is revealed to be Thomas Wayne , Bruce Wayne's Father and that Bruce had died instead of his parents. Barry tries to retrieve his costume from his ring but finds Professors Zoom's instead causing Barry to think Zoom is the one responsible for this change in reality. After explaining to Batman about the original timeline and that Bruce was Batman there, they decide to recreate the events which gave Barry his powers. However, the first attempt leaves his badly burned and injured.\n\n\nGeneral INFO :\n\nFormat                                   : Flash Video\nFile size                                : 505 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 29mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 789 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Encoded By\nTagging application                      : Yet Another Metadata Injector for FLV - Version 1.9\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;024a6b656a424e312c32&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : 7\nDuration                                 : 1h 29mn\nBit rate                                 : 700 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.101\nStream size                              : 445 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 128 r2 198a7ea\n\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 10\nDuration                                 : 1h 26mn\nBit rate                                 : 94.3 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDelay relative to video                  : 19ms\nStream size                              : 58.3 MiB (12%)\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb05c87078df8025f0df2df864d023459cea578a","amp;dn":"Justice+League+-+The+Flashpoint+Paradox+DVDRip+2013.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb05c87078df8025f0df2df864d023459cea578a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,5,200,112,120,223,128,37,240,223,45,248,100,208,35,69,156,234,87,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
