It was written by Ric Ocasek, and produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange and The Cars. Lead vocals were by Cars' bassist Benjamin Orr.\n\n&quot;Drive&quot; was The Cars' highest charting single in the United States, peaking at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. On the Adult Contemporary chart, the song went all the way to #1. It also got to #5 in the UK singles chart, becoming their second biggest UK hit, then was re-released in the UK in 1985 (after the Live Aid performance at Wembley Stadium), this time charting at #4. The song was also a big hit in what was West Germany, reaching #4, and in Canada, reaching #6. In addition, it was famously used as part of the Live Aid concert in 1985, as the background music to a montage of clips showing poverty-stricken Africa. The song is about drug abuse.\n\nThe music video for the song stars, besides Ocasek and Orr, Czech-born supermodel Paulina Porizkova, who later married Ocasek. The video was directed by actor Timothy Hutton.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79d7493984461909a8cf5b321d0c7ec46ca594db","amp;dn":"The+Cars+-+Drive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79d7493984461909a8cf5b321d0c7ec46ca594db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,215,73,57,132,70,25,9,168,207,91,50,29,12,126,196,108,165,148,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
