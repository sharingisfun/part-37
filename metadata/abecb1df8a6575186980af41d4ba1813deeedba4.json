After the success of their debut Defintely, Maybe, this is just as swaggering and confident but more mature, melodic and soulful. Every song from the album is arranged in guitar tablature and includes the huge hits DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Look Back In Anger, Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova and Roll With It.\n\n\nTracklisting!\n\n1 \tHello\n\n    Written-By [Hello - Excerpt Taken From - Hello, Hello I'm Back Again] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gary Glitter, Mike Leander\n\n\t3:21\n2 \tRoll With It \t3:59\n3 \tWonderwall \t4:18\n4 \tDon't Look Back In Anger \t4:48\n5 \tHey Now! \t5:41\n6 \tUntitled \t0:44\n7 \tSome Might Say\n\n    Drums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tony McCarroll\n\n\t5:29\n8 \tCast No Shadow \t4:51\n9 \tShe's Electric \t3:40\n10 \tMorning Glory \t5:03\n11 \tUntitled \t0:39\n12 \tChampagne Supernova\n\n    Lead Guitar, Backing Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Weller\n\n\t7:27","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abecb1df8a6575186980af41d4ba1813deeedba4","amp;dn":"Oasis+-+Whats+The+Story+Morning+Glory+%28Guitar+tab+book%29+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abecb1df8a6575186980af41d4ba1813deeedba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,236,177,223,138,101,117,24,105,128,175,65,212,186,24,19,222,238,219,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
