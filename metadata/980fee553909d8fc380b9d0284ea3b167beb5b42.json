Try Dispatch along with our software router, Connectify Hotspot PRO, absolutely risk-free!\n\nMultiple Connections, Maximum Speed\n\nFor the first time, you can connect to the coffee shop Wi-Fi and your 4G mobile device simultaneously, using both Internet connections for their combined speed, and increased reliability.\n\nWith Connectify Dispatch, you can even use two different Wi-Fi networks at the same time. Just connect a secondary USB Wi-Fi card (in addition to your laptopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on-board Wi-Fi card) and Dispatch does the rest. At the click-of-a-button, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be cruising the web at warp speed, using the combined throughput of both wireless networks. Even if you lose connectivity on one of those networks, Dispatch keeps you online, moving all of your traffic onto the working connection until both networks become available again.\n\nBut thats only one scenario, with Dispatch you can connect to as many Internet connections as you have adapters for. Tethered smart phones, ethernet and wired connections, 3G and 4G mobile broadband adapters, Wi-Fi and MiFi - you name it, Dispatch can use it. The more connections you have, the faster youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll go!\n\nAutomatic Failover\n\nUsing multiple connections, Connectify Dispatch always gives you the most reliable Internet access possible. Furthermore, Dispatch allows you to select priority levels for your available Internet connections.\n\nBy setting a connection to &quot;Backup&quot; Dispatch will only access it in the event that you lose connectivity on all of your &quot;Primary&quot; Internet connections. This way, you can easily designate a metered 3G or 4G modem, tethered device, or other expensive mobile broadband connection to be used only when absolutely necessary or in case of emergency.\n\nAccelerate Large BitTorrent Downloads\n\nBitTorrent makes use of many network sockets by design, so it is a perfect application for Connectify Dispatch. With each Internet connection you add, Dispatch can increase the speed of your torrent downloads significantly.\n\nShare your Super-Fast Dispatch Connection with Connectify Hotspot\n\nConnectify Dispatch is even more powerful when you use it alongside our flagship software router, Connectify Hotspot PRO. Just start a Connectify Hotspot while aggregating Internet connections with Dispatch, and in an instant youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be sharing your Dispatch Ã¢â‚¬Å“super connectionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ over Wi-Fi with all of your friends, co-workers, and other devices.\n\n\n\n                        Install Notes\n\n\n*Install the latest version of Connectify\n*Finish the entire installation\n*Now launch Connectify Activator\n*Click Activate PRO button\n*Activator will show a message box saying Connectify successfully activated\n*Wait 1 minute and Launch Connectify\n*ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it you are ready to go with Connectify PRO !\n*Launch Dispatch and make sure its PRO too\n\n\n\n              Will Be very thankful if you seed the torrent\n\n\n\n                  Any Problem Contact us on our FB page\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:980fee553909d8fc380b9d0284ea3b167beb5b42","amp;dn":"Connectify+Hotspot+Pro%2BDispatch+7.3.0.30245+-+Cyclonoid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"980fee553909d8fc380b9d0284ea3b167beb5b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,15,238,85,57,9,216,252,56,11,157,2,132,234,59,22,123,235,91,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
