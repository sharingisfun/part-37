You will learn standards, techniques, and conventions that are sharply focused, realistic and helpful for achieving results, steering clear of unproven, idealistic, and impractical recommendations.\n\nPro .NET Best Practices covers a broad range of practices and principles that development experts agree are the right ways to develop software, which includes continuous integration, automated testing, automated deployment, and code analysis. Whether the solution is from a free and open source or a commercial offering, you will learn how to get a continuous integration server running and executing builds every time code changes. You will write clearer and more maintainable automated testing code that focuses on prevention and helping your .NET project succeed. By learning and following the .NET best practices in this book, you will avoid making the same mistakes once.\n\nWith this book at your side, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get:\n\nReal-world, no-nonsense approaches to continuous integration, automated testing, automated deployment, and code analysis\nTips and tricks youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll need to clear hurdles that keep others from putting these common sense ideas into common practice\nGuidance from the minimal, essential approach all the way to whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s necessary to deliver at the highest levels of quality and effectiveness\nBenefit immediately, even before finishing it, from the knowledge, workable advice, and experience found in Pro .NET Best Practices.\n\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\n\nHow to set up a continuous integration server that executes builds every time code changes\nHow to create automated tests that are easier to write, easier to maintain, and focused on making sure the code-under-test works the way itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intended to work\nHow to write a common automated deployment script that deploys to all target environments\nHow to perform meaningful code analysis that gives the kind of information you can take action upon\nWhy some best practices, which were once fresh, are now stale; avoid this trap by following best practices grounded in correct principles that endure\nHow to gain support for following best practices from all project stakeholders by recognizing and overcoming biases, highlighting gaps, and demonstrating value\nWho this book is for\nPro .NET Best Practices is for the .NET developer who is ready to learn realistic, practicable, and truly helpful best practices.

ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s for .NET developers who want to stay away from practices that only have theoretical benefits and move toward ones with real value, especially within a skeptical project environment. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s for the technical lead who has seen best practices get started only to fall out of practice, and wants to understand what goes wrong and how to implement suitable best practices likely to be followed by project teams.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRuthlessly Helpful\n.NET Practice Areas\nAchieving Desired Results\nQuantifying Value\nStrategy\n.NET Rules and Regulations\nPowerful C# Constructs\nAutomated Testing\nBuild Automation\nContinuous Integration\nCode Analysis\nTest Frameworks\nAversions and Biases\nAppendix A: Resources\nAppendix B: Scorecard\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 372 pages\nPublisher: Apress (December 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1430240237\nISBN-13: 978-1430240235","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:348d4d3a04275db829712138add2d5a390b5ff5d","amp;dn":"Apress.Pro.NET.Best.Practices.Dec.2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"348d4d3a04275db829712138add2d5a390b5ff5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,141,77,58,4,39,93,184,41,113,33,56,173,210,213,163,144,181,255,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
