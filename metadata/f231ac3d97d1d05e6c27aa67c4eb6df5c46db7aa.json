If you like Tom Sharp then this is for you.\n\n\nMartin Carter is having a crook (bad) day. His home life's a misery, he's been retrenched by the bank and everyone's forgotten his birthday. But a million-dollar payroll, a pistol, and a split-second decision change everything. Hurtling north on a motorcycle with the intriguing Faith, Martin encounters a mysterious hit-man, a new-age bikie gang, a reclusive media mogul, and the booby-trapped mountain hideout of an old schoolmate. With Faith's help he learns about love again, along with some bitter truths about instant coffee, brown suede shoes, and the legendary Great Aussie Truck-stop Breakfast","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f231ac3d97d1d05e6c27aa67c4eb6df5c46db7aa","amp;dn":"Fat+Fifty+and+F%27ed+-+Geoff+McGeachin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f231ac3d97d1d05e6c27aa67c4eb6df5c46db7aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,49,172,61,151,209,208,94,108,39,170,103,196,235,109,245,196,109,183,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
