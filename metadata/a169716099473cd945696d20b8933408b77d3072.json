It is my turn to give, and I hope you will receive!\n\nI have a lot of music to share and a limited bandwidth to do so effectively. I am starting with Piano music, and have broken my music up into Composers. I will share 5 torrents per month for 3 months to ensure eveyone gets a chance to download them completely.\n\n\nUPLOAD DATES\n\nMonth 1 (3rd May 07 - 2nd June 07):\nAlbeniz - Piano Music\nBach - Piano Music\nBeethoven - Piano Music\nBrahms - Piano Music\nDebussy - Piano Music\n\nMonth 2 (3rd June 07 - 2nd July 07):\nDvorak - Piano Music\nGrieg - Piano Music\nMozart - Piano Music\nSatie - Piano Music\nSchumann - Piano Music\n\nMonth 3 (3rd July 07 - 2nd August 07):\nScriabin - Piano Music\nTchaikovsky - Piano Music\nTurina - Piano Music\nVilla-Lobos - Piano Music\nWeber - Piano Music\n\n\nIf there is a torrent that is no longer being seeded, just email me and I will begin seeding it again.

And share your collections too! Let&amp;#039;s get it all out there!\n\nShaun\n\n\n\nFILENAMES &amp; FORMATS\n\nI am meticulous in the organisation of my classical music. My filename structure is as follows:\n\neg\n\nRachmaninov - Larrocha - Piano Sonata n. 2, Op. 36 - 1 - Allegro agitato.wma\n     ^           ^               ^            ^      ^          ^         ^\n Composer     Performer        Piece        Opus   Mvmt n.   Movement   format\n\n\nI use this structure so that all the information is contained in the filename, instead of in the tag info or not at all. Filenames are sometimes really long, but this doesn&amp;#039;t bother me.\n\nI use mp3 and wma because these are the formats my portable mp3 player can read.\nMost of my music is kept at a modest 192kb/s (mp3) or 160kb/s (wma). I only sometimes keep symphonic music that I adore at higher bitrates, but for the most part, these bitrates are practical for me.\n\nAs for tag information:\n\nAlbum: Rachmaninov\nArtist: Larrocha\nGenre: Classical Piano\n\nI use this only for my mp3 player so I can navigate my music with ease. I use Audioshell for all my batch tag renaming.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a169716099473cd945696d20b8933408b77d3072","amp;dn":"Brahms+-+Piano+Music+%28Shaun%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a169716099473cd945696d20b8933408b77d3072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,105,113,96,153,71,60,217,69,105,109,32,184,147,52,8,183,125,48,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
