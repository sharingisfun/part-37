While in DC, why not participate in the local community,\nand run a few political errands?\n\nUp to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs\nbecome bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and\nbecoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting\nsystem that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.\n\nKey Features:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n*Rob Banks with Friends Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Players must choose their crew carefully, because\nwhen the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.\n\n*CRIMENET Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from\navailable jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian,\nshady politician &quot;The Elephant&quot;, and South American drug trafficker Hector,\nall with their own agenda and best interests in mind.\n\n*PAYDAY gun play and mechanics on a new level Ã¢â‚¬â€œ firing weapons and zip tying\ncivilians never felt so good.\n\n*Dynamic Scenarios Ã¢â‚¬â€œ No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single\nscenario has random geometry or even rare events.\n\n*Choose Your Skills Ã¢â‚¬â€œ As players progress they can invest in any of four\nspecial Skill Trees: the Mastermind, the Enforcer, the Ghost and the\nTechnician. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and\nequipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate\nheister.\n\n*More Masks than Ever Ã¢â‚¬â€œ PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving\nplayers the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern\nand a color combination.\n\n*Weapons and Modifications Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A brand new arsenal for the serious heister,\ncovering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs.\nOnce you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics,\nsuppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks, all of which will\naffect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic\nenhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips\nfor your nine?\n\n*Play It Your Way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and\nstealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you\nwant, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly.\n\n*****************************\n** **Install Notes:** **\n*****************************\n1. Unpack release\n2.
