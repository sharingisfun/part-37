After installation make\nsure all Internet Explorer and/or other browsers and explorer\nwindows are closed or else the file will not copy over properly\n(as well as the Roboform Taskbar Icon).  Reboot into safe mode if\nyou still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll and roboform-x64.dll\n(x64 dll is only needed for IE 64bit!) into AI Roboform's\ninstalled folder, making sure to overwrite the existing files.\nAI Roboform is now in the full PRO version with Enterprise\nfeatures.\n\nIncluded is the Enterprise policies tool with this release so you\ndon't need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the\nPolicyEditor folder.\n\nFeel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when\nyou run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a\ntaskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known\nas RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.\nIn IE 64bit it may show as Desktop ONLY in the about window, but\nif you have chosen Everywhere syncing is still performed\n(hopefully fixed in an update).  Its suggested to use a different\nRoboForm Everywhere password than your master password.  This way\nnobody will be able to decrypt your online database except you.\n\nNote that you can now choose either Everywhere or Desktop type of\ninstallation while first installing AI Roboform.  You can also\ntell which type of configuration its currently set at by opening\nthe About window from the taskbar icon, keep this running if you\nwant full time syncing with Everywhere.  Everywhere will show\nSync With [USERNAME], while Desktop will not show Sync.  This can\nbe changed at any time by going into Options then User Data and\nclicking on Settings button.\n\n** READ NFO NOTE: **\n\nAI Roboform now includes support for Internet Explorer 64bit.\nOnly users with a 64bit OS need to copy over the extra precracked\ndll (roboform-x64.dll) to AI Roboform's installed folder.\n\nThats it!
