It is considered to be Dylan's last of a trilogy of Christian albums. It was his first since becoming a born-again Christian to focus on secular themes, including love songs and an ode to comedian Lenny Bruce. Arrangements are rooted more in rock'n'roll, and less in gospel than Dylan's previous two albums.\n\nAt the time of its release, Shot of Love received mixed reviews; Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone criticised the album, though he did single out the last track &quot;Every Grain of Sand,&quot; as a stand-out. Shot of Love, while reaching UK #6, continued Dylan's US commercial decline, reaching #33 during a brief chart stay. Bono of Irish band U2 described Shot of Love as one of his favourites, particularly due to Dylan's singing ability.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Shot of Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:18\n    &quot;Heart of Mine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:29\n    &quot;Property of Jesus&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:33\n    &quot;Lenny Bruce&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:32\n    &quot;Watered-Down Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:10\n    &quot;Dead Man, Dead Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:58\n    &quot;In the Summertime&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n    &quot;Trouble&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:32\n    &quot;Every Grain of Sand&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:12","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8773d16f57636260f8556a34923ffd0f2f223e18","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Shot+Of+Love+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8773d16f57636260f8556a34923ffd0f2f223e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,115,209,111,87,99,98,96,248,85,106,52,146,63,253,15,47,34,62,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
