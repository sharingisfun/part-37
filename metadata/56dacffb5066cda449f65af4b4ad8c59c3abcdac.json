Delay time can be set from anywhere to 0-10 seconds. This means what you are hearing is the actual audio being recorded to disk in real time, as it happens.\n\nEcho has been shown to contribute to EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon)\n\nNote: The Echo is not a digital effect added to the sound. It is a loop of the actual recording. An external/BlueTooth speaker is recommended for best results, also the louder the better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56dacffb5066cda449f65af4b4ad8c59c3abcdac","amp;dn":"Echovox+Version+2.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56dacffb5066cda449f65af4b4ad8c59c3abcdac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,218,207,251,80,102,205,164,73,246,90,244,180,173,140,89,195,171,205,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
