Rancid has always been a fan of leader Roi Pearce and the band. We give a nod to them on the song The Ballad of Jimmy and Johnny from our LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Go recordÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jimmy Likes Ska, and Johnny Likes Last ResortÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. You need look no further than these guys, that we consider one of the greatest punk bands of all time. King Of The Jungle takes you on a journey through the inner-city jungle..This is our take on this great song.\n \nWritten by Roi Pearce and Arthur Kitchener\n \nTim Timebomb-Vocals,Guitar\nKevin Bivona-Guitar, Background Vocals\nJesse Bivona-Drums\nJustin Bivona-Bass","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8b7e527671cbc60eac81c393ceea2d95e1ae43c","amp;dn":"King+of+the+Jungle+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8b7e527671cbc60eac81c393ceea2d95e1ae43c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,183,229,39,103,28,188,96,234,200,28,57,60,238,162,217,94,26,228,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
