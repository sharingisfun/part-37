However, the shocking truth is that love and hatred are fully controlled by the mind. If you can come to understand the logic behind that mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operation then you will have a good chance of making someone fall in love with you.\n\nLove is just like any other psychological emotion you experience. Just as there are ways for dealing with and controlling stress, learning about the psychology of falling in love can be used to your advantage to make someone fall in love with you. This won't work one hundred percent of the time, but it will at least double or even triple your chances of making that person fall in love with you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b620db4b6ee376ea669c37bc0428a0e1148e573","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+How+to+make+someone+fall+in+love+with+you+%28by+M.+Farouk+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b620db4b6ee376ea669c37bc0428a0e1148e573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,98,13,180,182,238,55,110,166,105,195,123,192,66,138,14,17,72,229,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
