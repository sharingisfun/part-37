Some of the loops are over 30 seconds long, featuring filtering and variations. Tempos range from 132-140 bpm.\n\nTorrent contains 15 RAR files with 233 samples\n----------------------------------------------\nBass Loops (27)\nChords Loops (6)\nClap Loops (15)\nCymbal Loops (25)\nDrum Loops (22)\nHi-Hat Loops (23)\nKick loops (14)\nPad Loops (5)\nPerc Loops (17)\nSFX loops (8)\nShaker Loops (9)\nSnare Loops (5)\nString Loops (2)\nSweeps Loops (9)\nSynth Loops (46)\n\nThe construction kits did not have names, but are filed according to number, musical key and tempo. So, &quot;08 Amin Kick 135&quot; (a 4/4 kick drum loop) originally went together with &quot;08 Amin Bass 135&quot;, but can actually be used with any loop of the same tempo, since drums are not pitched in particular keys.\n\nAll files are normalized and acidized 16-bit WAVs at 44.1KHz. \n\n--\nArty - &quot;Rushing Roulette&quot;\n\nP.S.
