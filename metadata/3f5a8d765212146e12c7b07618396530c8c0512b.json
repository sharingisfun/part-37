Zij verruilt haar thuis voor Buenos Aires, samen met de zanger Agustin Megaldi. Uiteindelijk wordt ze de vrouw van president Juan Peron, en de held van het volk van ArgentiniÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«.\n\nAwards:\nIt was nominated for five Academy Awards and won the award for &quot;Best Song&quot; for &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;. Evita had five Golden Globe nominations and three wins (Best Picture - Comedy or Musical; Best Original Song, &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;; and Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical, Madonna) \n\n\nEnglish\n\nHigh-flying, adored! The film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical depicting the infamous real-life story of Eva &quot;Evita&quot; Duarte de Peron, the wife of President Juan Peron, who rose from poverty to become the most famous Argentine woman in history. Her huge political influence and constant charity works earned her scorn and fear from the military and upper classes but adoration and love from the workers and descamisados. Evita's legendary life is displayed before your eyes as the most hated and most beloved woman in Argentina.\n\n\nProduction and casting:\nDiscussion of the film production began soon after the original 1978 London production was staged. Several actresses were considered for the role. At one point, Lloyd Webber favoured an actress of Spanish descent to play the lead role and suggested Charo. Then Meryl Streep was offered the role, but production was delayed. Meanwhile, Madonna had been campaigning for the part but when Parker was ready for filming, several people[who?] objected to Madonna playing the part. Cher, Barbra Streisand, Glenn Close, Olivia Newton-John and Michelle Pfeiffer were rumored to be involved. Pfeiffer, who recorded a number of demo tracks, was almost cast, but director Alan Parker wanted to shoot the picture on location, not in Pfeiffer's preferred Hollywood sound studio. Patti LuPone was not offered to reprise her original role as Evita. As an actress in her forties she was deemed too old to play the part of Eva Peron. When the lead of Eva was announced, Madonna, Patti LuPone was asked to play the role of Eva's mother, but she declined.\n\nFilming began on February 1996 and it finished in May. Midway through production, Madonna discovered she was pregnant with daughter Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon who was born on October 14, 1996.\n\n\nSpotinformatie \nCategorie : Beeld \nFormaat : DVD9 \nBron : Retail\nSubs : English, Norwegian, Swedish, German, French, Dutch, Greek, Portuguese\nAudio : Englis 5.1\nMenu : Yes \n\nWeblink : &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.moviemeter.nl/film/999&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.moviemeter.nl/film/999&lt;/a&gt;\nWeblink : &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116250&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116250&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*****************************************\n\nBrought to you by \nPioen\n\n2Lions Team\n\nmeer zien??\nKom dan eens kijken op ons forum \n\n\n\n\n2Lions the site to be for all your Dutch MOVIES and more\n\n******************************************\n\n\nDON T HIT AND RUN Niet gelijk afhaken als de FILM binnen is blijf seeden. \n\nDon`t quit after you finished the download, but keep seeding\n\n\nThere are fake torrents from uploaders who use our team name.\nThose are not ours, or members from our team.\nWe 2Lions-Team are not responsible for the fake posts on our name\n\nWij 2Lions-Team zijn niet verantwoordelijk voor die zieke FAKE posten die op onze naam worden gedaan\n\n\n\n \n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f5a8d765212146e12c7b07618396530c8c0512b","amp;dn":"Evita+%281996%29+%28multi%29+2Lions-Team","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f5a8d765212146e12c7b07618396530c8c0512b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,90,141,118,82,18,20,110,18,199,176,118,24,57,101,48,200,192,81,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
