New Computer Express was a weekly UK-based computer magazine, which was begun in the late-80's and ceased publication a few years later. While covering the current computers of the day, it also devoted a couple of pages to providing regular articles of what were then seen as retro-computers - Sinclair Spectrum/QL, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC etc.\n\n\nNote that these scans are of fairly low quality, necessary in order to keep their size manageable.  Download an issue to check the quality if this is a consideration.  If you value this type of material then:\n\n\n***   PLEASE SEED   ***\n\n***   PLEASE SEED   ***\n\n***   PLEASE SEED   ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ffe51793610742f91094071370317a722f317d","amp;dn":"34+New+Computer+Express+magazines+%2880%27s+computer+mag%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ffe51793610742f91094071370317a722f317d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,255,229,23,147,97,7,66,249,16,148,7,19,112,49,122,114,47,49,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
