They were thrown together after guitarist Ray Glynn and drummer Dave Hynes decided to re-form The Mirage after a short stint in The Spencer Davis Group came to an end in 1969 (they appear on the excellent &quot;Short Change&quot; single and ill-fated Funky album).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaff2051cd16096c5017fee39b976192cc8bf773","amp;dn":"Jawbone+-+Jawbone+%281970%2F2007%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaff2051cd16096c5017fee39b976192cc8bf773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,255,32,81,205,22,9,108,80,23,254,227,155,151,97,146,204,139,247,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
