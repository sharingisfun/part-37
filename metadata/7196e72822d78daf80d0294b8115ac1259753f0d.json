While the state is an evil in all its forms, monarchy is, in many ways, far less pernicious than democracy. Hoppe shows the evolution of government away from aristocracy, through monarchy, and toward the corruption and irresponsibility of democracy to have been identical with the growth of the leviathan state. There is hope for liberty, as Hoppe explains, but it lies not in reversing these steps, but rather through secession and decentralization. This pocket-sized, eye-opening pamphlet is ideal for tabling, conferences, or sharing with friends. It can revolutionize the way a reader sees society and the state.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nHans-Hermann Hoppe was born on September 2, 1949, in Peine, West Germany. He attended the UniversitÃƒÂ¤t des Saarlandes, SaarbrÃƒÂ¼cken, the Goethe-UniversitÃƒÂ¤t, Frankfurt/M, and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, for studies in Philosophy, Sociology, History, and Economics.
