First micro expansion of a group of three for Sins of a Solar Empire, Entrenchment focuses primarily on the military &amp; scientific aspects in the game. New research and buildings (as mines) change the strategy of each of the three factions in the game. While the original game did not feature any single player campaign, Entrenchment is supposed to occur 15 years after the events in the original game. The three factions, at war, have entrenched themselves.\n[PC] Sins.of.a.Solar.Empire.Entrenchment\n\n\nGracias por visitar www EspaTorrents com\nThank you for visit www EspaTorrents com\n\n\n\ndo you want more games &amp; cine-online in good-quality???\n\nwww espaconsolas com &amp; www espaendirecto com\n\nThanks!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bda045454a2de7de5051cefddf8bc9048ab2d2e0","amp;dn":"Sins.of.a.Solar.Empire.Entrenchment-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bda045454a2de7de5051cefddf8bc9048ab2d2e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,160,69,69,74,45,231,222,80,81,206,253,223,139,201,4,138,178,210,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
