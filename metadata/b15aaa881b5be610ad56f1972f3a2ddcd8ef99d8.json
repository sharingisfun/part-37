ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rare for me to be drawn to music with such an emotional quality, but I find myself returning time and time again to DigitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perfectly nonchalant songs. The Toronto musicianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brand of electronic indie pop has a strange sense of isolation, often bordering on loneliness, but his music has a way of expressing more than that, reveling in a kind of diffident awkwardness. AltmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics steer the music for the most part, resting alongside his dainty guitar chords and soft electro synths, but it is his bass lines that add life and colour to the songs, adding a bouncy adolescent energy to counteract the musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s overall shyness.\n\nAltman started Digits in March, 2009, and released his debut album Hold It Close on September 24. The album can be downloaded from his bandcamp page. A couple of the tracks are free but I recommend that you pay the little bit extra and download the whole album.\n\n- Nick Fulton, Einstein Music Journal\n\ndigits.bandcamp.com\nwww.digitsmusic.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15aaa881b5be610ad56f1972f3a2ddcd8ef99d8","amp;dn":"Digits+-+Hold+It+Close","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15aaa881b5be610ad56f1972f3a2ddcd8ef99d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,90,170,136,27,91,230,16,173,86,241,151,47,58,45,220,216,239,153,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
