For every man eater Dallas and Roper put down, twelve more are created.\n\nAfter spending nearly a year in the bayou, the survivors once again, set out in search of a safe haven where they might do more than survive, but thrive. \nThrive among the hordes bearing down on them. Thrive amid government attacks on the new compound they call home. \n\nAs Dallas and Roper build a new life, the ever present military launches surprise attacks, the bloody horde keeps on clawing at the walls, and the rest of mankind devolves into something barbaric and unrecognizable.\n\nCan Dallas and Roper lead their people through the maze of thinking and brain dead killers? Can they find a place to once and for all go on the offensive? \n\nOr it is, as some survivors believe, too late?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec610378c97732c3983228af9a0c4b608f007246","amp;dn":"FF+July+29%2C+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec610378c97732c3983228af9a0c4b608f007246","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,97,3,120,201,119,50,195,152,50,40,175,154,12,75,96,143,0,114,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
