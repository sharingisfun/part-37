Jews came to dominate the world of western society\ncomedy on radio, stage and screen alike. Why did Jews dominate comedy in this period?\nAnd why did that domination end? Were Jews just funnier back then? And if so, did\nthat extend to your average Jew on the street? In this 90 minute documentary\nacclaimed director Alan Zweig will examine these questions and many others in this\nexploration of 20th century humour, cultural decay, and a search for a missing\nheritage\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d71e99722a55ead193b6e5e1d77ad5e0b78786a","amp;dn":"When.Jews.Were.Funny.2013.DVDRip.x264-PHOBOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d71e99722a55ead193b6e5e1d77ad5e0b78786a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,113,233,151,34,165,94,173,25,59,110,94,29,119,173,94,11,120,120,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
