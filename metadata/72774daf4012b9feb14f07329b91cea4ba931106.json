Gwyn Hyman RubioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautifully written first novel revolves around Icy Sparks, an unforgettable heroine in the tradition of Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird or Will Treed in Cold Sassy Tree. At the age of ten, Icy, a bright, curious child orphaned as a baby but raised by adoring grandparents, begins to have strange experiences. Try as she might, her &quot;secrets&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€verbal croaks, groans, and physical spasmsÃ¢â‚¬â€keep afflicting her. As an adult, she will find out she has TouretteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, but for years her behavior is the source of mystery, confusion, and deep humiliation.\n\nNarrated by a grown up Icy, the book chronicles a difficult, but ultimately hilarious and heartwarming journey, from her first spasms to her self-acceptance as a young woman. Curious about life beyond the hills, talented, and energetic, Icy learns to cut through all barriersÃ¢â‚¬â€physical, mental, and spiritualÃ¢â‚¬â€in order to find community and acceptance.\n\nAlong her journey, Icy faces the jeers of her classmates as well as the malevolence of her often-ignorant teachersÃ¢â‚¬â€including Mrs. Stilton, one of the most evil fourth grade teachers ever created by a writer. Called willful by her teachers and &quot;Frog Child&quot; by her schoolmates, she is exiled from the schoolroom and sent to a childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s asylum where it is hoped that the roots of her mysterious behavior can be discovered. Here Icy learns about differenceÃ¢â‚¬â€her own and those who are even more scarred than she. Yet, it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until Icy returns home that she really begins to flower, especially through her friendship with the eccentric and obese Miss Emily, who knows first-hand how it feels to be an outcast in this tightly knit Appalachian community. Under Miss EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tutelage, Icy learns about lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggles and rewards, survives her first comical and heartbreaking misadventure with romance, discovers the healing power of her voice when she sings, and ultimatelyÃ¢â‚¬â€takes her first steps back into the world.\n\nGwyn Hyman RubioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Icy Sparks is a fresh, original, and completely redeeming novel about learning to overcome othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ignorance and celebrate the differences that make each of us unique.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72774daf4012b9feb14f07329b91cea4ba931106","amp;dn":"Icy+Sparks+-+Gwyn+Hyman+Rubio+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72774daf4012b9feb14f07329b91cea4ba931106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,119,77,175,64,18,185,254,177,79,7,50,155,145,206,164,186,147,17,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
