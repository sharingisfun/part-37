Nicknamed &quot;The Humbler&quot; after a bootleg cassette surfaced of a Robert Gordon show featuring Danny as the lead guitarist, his reputation gradually spread across the country and overseas.  The fact that he became a cult guitar hero at all is amazing because of his reclusive nature, hatred of touring and love of customizing hot rod cars.  As the live sides presented here attest, when he made the effort to mingle with the masses it was &quot;Don't Miss&quot;.  I saw Danny touring the 88 Elmira St. album with his long time band of cohorts and it was a great show.  The way they interacted on stage reminded me of Elvis Presley's band with Scotty Moore.  Fans of Roy Buchannon will appreciate this. Danny had the redneck blues/rock flashy guitar stuff down but his vocabulary extended beyond that to include bebop, modern jazz, western swing, rockabilly and so much more.\n\nThe albums are:\n\n88 Elmira St\nCruisin' Deuces\nThe Humbler Stakes His Claim (Live In 1977)\nThe Humbler- Live (with Robert Gordon)\nRelentless (with Joey DeFrancesco)\nIn Concert\nUnfinished Business\n\nEnjoy and please seed!;-}\n\nJunco\n      ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26638bf76c0a8b020fbcfe2aa78f74a2b7421b54","amp;dn":"Danny+Gatton+-+7+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26638bf76c0a8b020fbcfe2aa78f74a2b7421b54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,99,139,247,108,10,139,2,15,188,254,42,167,143,116,162,183,66,27,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
