It has a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.7.[3]\n\nThe film won the prestigious Palme d'Or and Best Actress (Brenda Blethyn) awards at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival,[1] and Golden Globe and \n\nBAFTA Best Actress awards.\n\nThe film was also nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Brenda Blethyn), Best Actress in a Supporting Role \n\n(Marianne Jean-Baptiste), Best Director, Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.\n\nInfluential film critic Roger Ebert entered the film to his Great Movies\n \ncollection in 2009.[4]\n\n    BAFTA\n        Best Actress - Brenda Blethyn - WON\n        Best Film\n        Best British Film - WON\n        Best Screenplay - WON\n        Best Supporting Actress\n\nVIDEO\nI have worked to find and use the &quot;best&quot; avisynth technology on the DVD source, and applied the strongest denoising/sharpening that wouldn't \n\nremove any noticable precision (and obv. thanx to high quality x264 encoding not loose anything noticeable there too).\nI think the result is NICER to MOST eyes than the DVD ! Download the sample if you don't believe me.\nAnyway, as far as compressed version go, it's the best you'll find around, the reasson being that I wouldn't have bothered making another release if \n\nthe offer was satisfying.\n\nDuration                         : 2h 21mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 769 Kbps\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;246c4d434c6468100a15&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 464 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\nAUDIO\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage                         : English\n\nSUBTITLES\nDutch\nEnglish\nEnglish-Hearing Impaired\nFrench\nHebrew\nPolish\nPortuguese\nPortuguese-Brazilian\nSerbian\nSpanish\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69cd9f914b38b86d3e3e3ce9e34e999b89ff37dd","amp;dn":"Secrets+%26amp%3B+Lies-1996-DVDRip-x264_OPTIMIZED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69cd9f914b38b86d3e3e3ce9e34e999b89ff37dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,205,159,145,75,56,184,109,62,62,60,233,227,78,153,155,137,255,55,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
