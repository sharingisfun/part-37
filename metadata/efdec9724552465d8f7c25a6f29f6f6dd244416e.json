It was released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and MS-DOS platforms.\nPlot\n\nIn the role of Lieutenant Ellen Ripley, the player experiences a story loosely derived from the first three films of the Alien franchise. Aside from occasional CGI cut scenes, the plot is told through text-based mission briefings that guide the player through an expanded, action-oriented story, drawing upon the settings and characters of the then-trilogy rather than through the specific plots of the films themselves.\n\nThe game begins in essentially the same manner as Aliens, as RipleyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶here a marine herselfÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶travels to LV426 to restore contact with the colony there. The other marines are wiped out, so Ripley must then travel through the infested colony and prison facility, and finally the crashed alien ship itself, to destroy the aliens and escape.\nReception\n\nAlien Trilogy received generally positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the PlayStation version 77.50%, the Sega Saturn version 77.00% and the PC version 43.00%] IGN gave the game an 8/10. General criticisms included the Doom-like shooting mechanics, occasionally confusing level layout and lack of narrative direction. Irwin Fletcher of Game Revolution praised the high production values, commenting that &quot;Alien Trilogy is nothing revolutionary, but it's a damn good shooter.&quot; The first game was a bestseller in the UK.\n\n1.Extract anywhere.\n2.Press &quot;START THE GAME&quot; batch file.\n3.Play.\n\nCompatible with WIN-ALL\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efdec9724552465d8f7c25a6f29f6f6dd244416e","amp;dn":"Alien+Trilogy+%281996%29+-+WIN-ALL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efdec9724552465d8f7c25a6f29f6f6dd244416e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,222,201,114,69,82,70,93,143,124,37,166,242,159,111,109,210,68,65,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
