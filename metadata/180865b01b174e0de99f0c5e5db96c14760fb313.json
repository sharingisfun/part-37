Many of the tracks (Island of Souls&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;) verge (impressively) on classical art song territory. For some, however, the good news here is that Sting is playing bass again; his simple yet effective lines are heard to particular advantage on the upbeat pop gem &quot;All This Time.&quot; Another high point is &quot;Saint Agnes and the Burning Town,&quot; a flamenco-inflected instrumental tour de force unlike anything in Sting's catalogue.\r\n\r\nRecorded at Studio Guilaume Tell, Paris, France and Villa Salviati, Migliarino, Italy.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
