L O N S are very unique and they got their own style and sound on this funny concept album where you follow them a day trough school.  Dinco Dean, Charlie Brown and the well known Busta Rhymes share the mic, while Cut Monitor Milo bring the beats and scratches.\n \n\nThis is really worth checking out.  \n\nEjoy\n\n\n\nNext upload: 3rd Bass - &quot; Derelicts of Dialect&quot; \n\n\nSpace Ace\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb06d34c5fe8882bbfc6395d5478a9f7978a524","amp;dn":"Leaders+Of+The+New+School+-+Future+without+a+past+%281991+BustaRhy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb06d34c5fe8882bbfc6395d5478a9f7978a524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,176,109,52,197,254,136,130,187,252,99,149,213,71,138,159,121,120,165,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
