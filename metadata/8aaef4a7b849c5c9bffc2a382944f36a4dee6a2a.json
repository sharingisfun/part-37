The only obstacle is her attraction to the woman she has vowed to destroy. \n\nYoung Cate Canton dreams of becoming a designer and running Seraphim, the Boston fashion house her late mother started. Born into a loving family, and with everything to live for, she loses all when she is wrongly accused of a crime. In the aftermath of tragedy and betrayal, Cate vows to reclaim her destiny. Fueled by revenge, she becomes a ruthless business woman who builds her own successful fashion empire, plotting to one day take over her mother's business by any means necessary. \n\nBut one person stands in her way--Dita Newton, the beautiful, gifted designer who now runs Seraphim. Cate will need to crush her lifelong adversary to succeed, but Dita strikes back in the most unexpected way--by stirring Cate's fragile, hidden heart. A contemporary high-stakes drama between two driven, passionate women.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aaef4a7b849c5c9bffc2a382944f36a4dee6a2a","amp;dn":"FF+I.+Beacham+-+Sanctuary.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aaef4a7b849c5c9bffc2a382944f36a4dee6a2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,174,244,167,184,73,197,201,191,252,42,56,41,68,243,106,77,238,106,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
