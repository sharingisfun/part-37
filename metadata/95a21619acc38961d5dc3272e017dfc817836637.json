Over eight weeks their cake-baking, pastry, bread-making     \n  and patisserie skills are tested to the limit as they are challenged  \n  to bake everything from the perfect tarte au citron to towers of      \n  macaroons, and iced fingers to family pies. All the challenges are    \n  devised by legendary cookery writer and baker Mary Berry and          \n  acclaimed master baker Paul Hollywood who are also on hand to judge   \n  and taste their efforts.                                              \n                                                                        \n  This first show sees the twelve amateur bakers challenged to make 24  \n  beautifully flavoured and decorated cupcakes in two hours and the     \n  stress of highly pressurised surroundings of the Bake Off's open      \n  plan kitchen soon shows. Next up, the technical challenge - to make   \n  a coffee and walnut battenberg cake from one of Mary Berry's recipes  \n  that delivers drastically different results.                          \n                                                                        \n  Finally, for a place in the next round of Bake Off they have to make  \n  and bake a tiered showstopper cake. But whose cakes will have the     \n  wow factor and who will be the first to leave The Great British Bake  \n  Off?                                                                  \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fb8ccf9d98899e8cbb9c969a9297d5989496&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a21619acc38961d5dc3272e017dfc817836637","amp;dn":"The.Great.British.Bake.Off.S02E01.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a21619acc38961d5dc3272e017dfc817836637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,162,22,25,172,195,137,97,213,220,50,114,224,23,223,200,23,131,102,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
