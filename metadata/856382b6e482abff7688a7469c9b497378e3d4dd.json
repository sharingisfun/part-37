Treaties can be signed between two empires, varying from the basic trade agreement to full-blown partnerships and even protectorates. The player can also conduct intelligence operations, also varying greatly, from simple information gathering missions to ship bombs to inciting revolt on a planet.\n\nInterstellar travel in Space Empires is not faster-than-light drive based, but instead relies on anomalies called &quot;warp points&quot;, essentially small wormholes between two star systems. Warp points are naturally occurring but a player can open and close these warp points if he has the appropriate technologies, which when used in the hands of an experienced player can turn the tide of an entire game.\n\nGenre: Turn based space strategy game\nFormat: Exe, Rar and Zip formats.\nPubliser: Malfador Machinations\nSize: 2.03GB (all games, ships and mods)\n\n\nSpace Empires I and II\n====================\nSystem Requirements\nIBM PC 100MHz 80486 compatible or faster\nWindows 3.1\nDisplay resolution of 640x480 or better\nDisplay of 16 colors or better\n8MB RAM\n4MB of hard drive space\nMicrosoft-compatible mouse\n\nRecommended\nIBM PC 90MHz Pentium compatible or faster\n16MB RAM\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.malfador.com/Se2.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.malfador.com/Se2.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpace Empires III\n====================\nSystem Requirements\nIBM PC 100MHz 80486 compatible or faster\nWindows 95\nDisplay resolution of 640x480 or better\nDisplay of 256 colors or better\n8MB RAM\n4MB of hard drive space\nMicrosoft-compatible mouse\n\nRecommended\nIBM PC 90MHz Pentium compatible or faster\n16MB RAM\nDisplay resolution of 800x600\nDisplay of Hi-Color (16-bit)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.malfador.com/se3.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.malfador.com/se3.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpace Empires IV\n====================\nSystem Requirements\nPentium class machine\nWindows 98/ME/2000/XP\n128MB RAM\n800x600 or better screen resolution\n16bit color or better color depth\n300 megs hard drive space\nDirectX 8.1 or higher\nWindows Compatible Sound Card\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.malfador.com/se4.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.malfador.com/se4.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpace Empires V\n====================\nSystem Requirements\nPentium 500 MHz or better class machine\nWindows 98/ME/2000/XP\n128MB RAM\n1024x768 or better screen resolution\n16bit color or better color depth\n500 megs hard drive space\nA video card with 3D acceleration\nDirectX 8.1 or higher\nA sound card capable of supporting MP3 and DirectSound playback.
