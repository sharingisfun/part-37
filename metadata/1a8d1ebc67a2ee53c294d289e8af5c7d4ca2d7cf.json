The first issue was released on June 9, 2010 and the second issue was released on July 7, 2010.\n\nMeta 4 begins with an astronaut waking on a beach with amnesiaÃ¢â‚¬â€he is unable to recall how he got there. The astronaut meets a large muscular woman named &quot;Gasolina&quot; who is dressed in a costume resembling that of Santa Claus. The astronaut notices a number of scars on his body that he can not explain. Author Ted McKeever has called the significance of these scars twofold: &quot;They are both evidence of a mystery that will unfold as the story progresses, as well as a textured map that has meaning to it because of where they are on his body&quot;.\n\n\nAll files in CBR and/or CBZ format\nDownload CDisplay here - http://www.cdisplay.me/\n\n\nNot my scans/rips, only collected them and put them all together.\n\n\nPlease SEED\nLong Live Pirate Bay!\n\nPeace to all ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8d1ebc67a2ee53c294d289e8af5c7d4ca2d7cf","amp;dn":"Ted+McKeever%26acute%3Bs+META4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8d1ebc67a2ee53c294d289e8af5c7d4ca2d7cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,141,30,188,103,162,238,83,194,148,210,137,232,175,92,125,76,162,215,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
