May, Costas J. Spanos\n\nA practical guide to semiconductor manufacturing from process control to yield modeling and experimental design\n\nFundamentals of Semiconductor Manufacturing and Process Control covers all issues involved in manufacturing microelectronic devices and circuits, including fabrication sequences, process control, experimental design, process modeling, yield modeling, and CIM/CAM systems. Readers are introduced to both the theory and practice of all basic manufacturing concepts.\n\nFollowing an overview of manufacturing and technology, the text explores process monitoring methods, including those that focus on product wafers and those that focus on the equipment used to produce wafers. Next, the text sets forth some fundamentals of statistics and yield modeling, which set the foundation for a detailed discussion of how statistical process control is used to analyze quality and improve yields.\n\nJohn 3:16\nKing James Version (KJV)\n\n16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dad918fe8e8187bfa32b106cc00df66c8a7ab29","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Semiconductor+Manufacturing+and+Process+Control+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dad918fe8e8187bfa32b106cc00df66c8a7ab29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,173,145,143,232,232,24,123,250,50,177,6,204,0,223,102,200,167,171,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
