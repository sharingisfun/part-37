Hucker.\r\n\r\nA work unique in the sweep of its design and scope, intended expressly for the general reader interested in human history and culture, this is a vivid panoramic survey of the vast course of Chinese civilization from prehistory to 1850, when the old China began the agonizing transition to the new. Historical surveys of China tend to be dynasty-by-dynasty chronicles with a profusion of names and dates and occaisional cultural tidbits, or to concentrate on the period from earliest times to the Han dynasty (or the T'ang), giving only scant coverage to the last thousand years. China's Imperial Past is different. Not only does it treat the three major periods of Chinese history at roughly equal length, weaving all their complexity into a balanced, integrated whole, but it gives ample space to China's magnificent literary and artistic achievements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2511e0fa545c1df7fc30bc8d53992b46e9811325","amp;dn":"China%27s+imperial+past+%28History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2511e0fa545c1df7fc30bc8d53992b46e9811325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,17,224,250,84,92,29,247,252,48,188,141,83,153,43,70,233,129,19,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
