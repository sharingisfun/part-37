Ravikiran and V.M. Bhatt on a selection of tunes that ultimately owe more to obvious blues clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s than they do to cross-cultural collaboration.  Perhaps that's because nearly half of the album's tunes -- including Robert Johnson's 'Come on in My Kitchen,' 'Mary Don't You Weep,' and 'Johnny Too Bad' -- have long been staples of Taj Mahal's concert catalog.  This isn't to say that the set doesn't have any moments of inspired improvisation and nuanced playing; there are a few instances of brilliance.  But that seems a terrible waste of the talent gathered, unless the listener is looking for nothing more than an unlikely blues workout. ~ Brian Beatty, AMG\n\nThe passion heard in the selections nearly brings me to tears inside. for some reason this collaboration hits me right to the center of my heart and soul--like a type of music i've been waiting for and finally found. maybe there is a previously unreleased version of 'Amazing Grace' that will show up on a later digitally remastered disc.  If only we could know what other songs they had considered incorporating.  Yes..it's that Good ! Gospel-Blues-Reggae, it's all here for the taking.  Cherish the moment over and over. ~ Dave P.\n \nPersonnel:\nTaj Mahal (Vocal and Guitar) \nNarasimhan Ravikian (Chitra Veena) \nVishwa Mohan Bhatt (Mohan Veena) \n\nTaj Mahal - Mumtaz Mahal Tracks:\n01  Coming of the Mandinka (Taj Mahal) 5:14 \n02  Come On in My Kitchen (Robert Johnson) 11:31 \n03  Rolling on the Sea (Taj Mahal) 5:01 \n04  Mary Don't You Weep (Traditional/arr.
