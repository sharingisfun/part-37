Rarely do they ever seem to find anything bad. \n\n\nIN THIS EPISODE\n\nLisa Lisson, CEO of FedEx Express Canada, knows how to deliver. But as a single mother with a high stress job, she also believes in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. FedEx is consistently listed as one of the top 50 best Canadian employers and Lisa knows to be number one, the FedEx work environment needs to improve. She believes that when employees are engaged, committed and motivated by their leaders and work culture, they are driven to contribute to the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well being. Lisa goes undercover to ensure employees have the tools they need to succeed - and that FedEx not only delivers to its customers, but also to its valuable employees.\n\n\n\nINFO ON THE FILE\nName           Undercover.Boss.Canada.s01e10.FedEx.HDTV.XviD-2HD.avi\nDate           5 April 2012\nRelease Date   6 April 2012\nSource         W HD\nDuration       44.52\nResolution     624x352\nFrame Rate     23.976\nVideo Bitrate  948 Kbps\nVideo Codec    XviD\nAudio          128 kbps 48 KHz joint stereo\nAudio Codec    mp3\n\n\n2HD has this thing for contracting the name of the show to Undercover Boss CA; contraction expanded losslessly ;)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b57955ad8217aa81f92a6a1c4c9391b33fdc87e","amp;dn":"Undercover.Boss.Canada.s01e10.FedEx.HDTV.XviD-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b57955ad8217aa81f92a6a1c4c9391b33fdc87e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,87,149,90,216,33,122,168,31,146,166,161,196,201,57,27,51,253,200,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
