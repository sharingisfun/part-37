The people associated with this allpowerful group are mainly government or corporate insiders which have put their skills at work in this incestous group which represents the ultimate merger of state and corporation. If you want to meet people that actually profit from all the bloodshed and wars going on today be sure to pick up this amazing book. For bussinesses such as Carlyle group 11th September 2001 attacks were like a blessing from the sky. 230 pages, few documents. A must read from everyone.\n\nFrom the backcover:\nTo the outside observer, the Carlyle Group-one of the largest private equity firms in the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½may seem like just another company trying to maneuver its way through the complex world of finance and investing. But there is more to this organization than meets the eye. With $14 billion under management, an employee roster that reads like a who&amp;#039;s who from the worlds of business and politics, and hundreds of defense, aerospace, telecom and healthcare companies in its portfolio, the Carlyle Group operates within a powerful and profitable world known as the iron triangleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a place where industry, government, and the military converge.\nBut, for the Carlyle Group, doing business at the murky intersection of Washington politics, national security, and private capital has come at a price. According to some, the Carlyle Group is a company that epitomizes corporate cronyism, conflicts of interest, and war profiteeringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and they may be right.\nIn The Iron Triangle: Inside the Secret World of the Carlyle Group, award-winning business journalist Dan Briody closely examines the dealings of this group and explores the high-powered individuals who make up a company which is enigmatically self-described as &quot;a vast interlocking global network.&quot; You&amp;#039;ll go inside the Carlyle Group and watch how deals are made and governments swayed to accept the Carlyle way. And you&amp;#039;ll learn how questions abound when you&amp;#039;re playing for keeps.\nWitness how the Carlyle Group:\n- Profited from the September 11th terrorist attacks and continues to profit from the ongoing war on terrorism\n- Pried open the wallets of Saudi Arabia and South Korea through the whirlwind business trips of former President George Bush\n- Liquidated holdings from the estranged family of Osama bin Laden only after news reports revealed the company&amp;#039;s association with the family\n- Went into overdrive to save the outdated Crusader howitzer which was being built by United DefenseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a Carlyle company\n- Was born through the Great Eskimo Tax ScamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a tax loophole used by cofounders Stephen Norris and David Rubenstein that has since been sewn up\n- Found what would become their identityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ defense contractingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with the help of former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucd\n\nFull of clandestine meetings, quid pro quo deals, bitter ironies, and petty jealousies, The Iron Triangle is a world that few could ever imagine.\nDAN BRIODY is an award-winning business journalist who has written for Forbes, Wired, Red Herring, and the Industry Standard. Briody is credited with breaking the story on the Carlyle Group. Since Red Herring published his article &quot;Carlyle&amp;#039;s Way,&quot; Briody has appeared on numerous radio and television programs to discuss the Carlyle Group and has become a primary source for other journalists covering this story.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3391b40089d7596002d63e96e057d4e1d3ffa985","amp;dn":"Briody-Iron+Triangle%28corporations+who+profit+from+wars%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3391b40089d7596002d63e96e057d4e1d3ffa985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,145,180,0,137,215,89,96,2,214,62,150,224,87,212,225,211,255,169,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
