The only supported resolutions at this moment are 240x320, 320x240 and 480x272.\n\n2. At this moment it runs only with presence of an SD Card, however it does not mean it has to run form SD Card. This is license limitation.\n\n3. There is a problem with the backlight on some PDA devices. Until this is solved, you should set the backlight in Windows power management console (settings of the device itself).\n\n4. Do not use R1 content like maps, poi's, buildings. Some appear to be working, but better is to use R3 content, the latest work just fine on iGO8 (R3) and iGO Amigo (R4).\n\n5. Original Amigo voice packages (not included) are same as for iGO8 R3. So for voice, use iGO8 R3 voice packages. \n\n6. To enable BUILDINGS and TMC functionality, add this license into your AMIGO/LICENSE folder\n\npass moslek\n\ncredits: \n- JetMouse (our almighty c*****der)\n- SkyRocker (supplier and tester)\n- Twingo (tester)\n- LZF (data file modifications and tester)\n- dansidragos \n\n\nAll the credits to JM, LZF &amp; Co\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bae1f364127eac29371e10ac02d3d1c76ff16be","amp;dn":"igo+amigo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bae1f364127eac29371e10ac02d3d1c76ff16be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,174,31,54,65,39,234,194,147,113,225,10,192,45,61,28,118,255,22,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
