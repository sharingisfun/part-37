Their first CD was released in 2004, it was released on Dr. Chud's very own Bloodwork Records label, it was named Diagnosis for Death. The first 1000 copies of Diagnosis For Death are limited edition and were signed, numbered, and came with a free vinyl sticker. In 2005 it was released on purple vinyl. Only 1250 were released. Every Halloween the band goes on tour.\n\n[center]This torrent has both the CD release and the single that was found on the purple vinyl only. Also included are a few avatars gif and png as well as a few ash can posters and the CD cover at 500x500 so you can print it out and make it a slip cover.[/center]\n\nI only upload to kat tpb ET fenopy if you see my uploads elsewhere they have either been indexed or if you see them under someone else's name do not trust em.
