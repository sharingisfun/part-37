Martin Company.\nThe first bomber in the Pacific theater and Aleutian Islands in 1942, it was also used in the European Theater of Operations and in the North African Campaign. The plane distinguished itself as &quot;the chief bombardment weapon on the Western Front&quot; according to an Army Air Forces dispatch from 1946, and also because the B-26B maintained the lowest loss record of any combat aircraft during World War II. Its loss record stands in sharp contrast to its unofficial nickname &quot;The Widowmaker&quot; ? earned due to its high rate of accidental crashes during takeoff for the B-26A variant.\n\n\nVideo Codec Code ...: DIVX\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1214 KB/s\nResolution .........: 720 x 480\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.50:1\nFramerate ..........: 29,970 FPS\n\nAudio Codec Code ...: 85 (0x0055)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\n\nTake a look here: http://b26marauder.com/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f998d1e1c2355f8ee79338d3be4bfe660d19643","amp;dn":"Aviation%3A+B-26+Marauder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f998d1e1c2355f8ee79338d3be4bfe660d19643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,153,141,30,28,35,85,248,238,121,51,141,59,228,191,230,96,209,150,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
