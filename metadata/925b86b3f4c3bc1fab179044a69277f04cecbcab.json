However he does not have any special power except for his broad knowledge, sharp insight, and impeccable instinct about &quot;MOE&quot; and its products, from manga to anime to games to light novel to figures. One day he found himself transported to a fantasy world where elves live and dragons fly. And he is given a taskÃ¢â‚¬â€not to fight monster or embark on a quest, but to enhance cultural exchange by becoming a &quot;moe missionary&quot; in this fantasy world! He meets a palace guard who has a bit of fujoshi taste, a half-elf maid, and the empress who is a little girl. He comes up with the idea of building a school. At first it runs as a comedy but later there are serious matters that Shinichi needs to face: ethnic discrimination, social problems, conflict with neighboring countries, sabotage by opposition elements including Japanese government, etc. Can he overcome the obstacles, successfully bring &quot;moe&quot; culture to the fantasy world, and help the people there as well?\n\nRaws: Ohys-Raws\n\nSubs: Anime-Koi (Modified by me)\n\nEnjoy! If you spot anything I missed please comment below and I will have it fixed!\n\nFYI, I fixed the opening and ending credits!\n\nAlso for episode 1, you'll notice that the opening and ending subs do not have the same animation set and I do not know how to change it to the same as episode 2+. The font, however is the same.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925b86b3f4c3bc1fab179044a69277f04cecbcab","amp;dn":"%5BJacobSwaggedUp%5D+Outbreak+Company+%5BBD%5D%5B720p-AAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925b86b3f4c3bc1fab179044a69277f04cecbcab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,91,134,179,244,195,188,31,171,23,144,68,166,146,119,240,76,236,188,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
