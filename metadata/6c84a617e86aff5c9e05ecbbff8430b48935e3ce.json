R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood novels have introduced readers to a &quot;different, creative, dark, violent, and flat-out amazing&quot; (All About Romance) world.\n\nNow, as the vampire warriors defend their race against their slayers, one male's loyalty to the Brotherhood will be tested - and his dangerous mixed blood revealed.\n\nRehvenge has always kept his distance from the Brotherhood - even though his sister is married to a member - for he harbors a deadly secret that could make him a huge liability in their war against the lessers. As plots within and outside of the Brotherhood threaten to reveal the truth about Rehvenge, he turns to the only source of light in his darkening world: Ehlena, a vampire untouched by the corruption that has its hold on him - and the only thing standing between him and eternal destruction.\n\nListen to another Black Dagger Brotherhood chiller. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c84a617e86aff5c9e05ecbbff8430b48935e3ce","amp;dn":"J+R+Ward++-+Black+Dagger+Brotherhood+07+-+Lover+Avenged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c84a617e86aff5c9e05ecbbff8430b48935e3ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,132,166,23,232,106,255,92,158,5,236,187,255,132,48,180,137,53,227,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
