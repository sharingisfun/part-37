PDF, scan but no OCR, so not searchable.\n\nHardcover: 1808 pages\nPublisher: Hackett Publishing Company (May 1997)\nLanguage: English\nISBN: 9780872203495\n\n\nOutstanding translations by leading contemporary scholars -- many commissioned especially for this volume -- are presented here in the first single edition to include the entire surviving corpus of works attributed to Plato in antiquity. In his introductory essay, John Cooper explains the presentation of these works, discusses questions concerning the chronology of their composition, comments on the dialogue form in which Plato wrote, and offers guidance on approaching the reading and study of Plato's works. Also included are concise introductions to each translation, meticulous annotation designed to serve both scholar and general reader, and a comprehensive index.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:286b3157b7d11b98c3c3948e8124786c45bf1486","amp;dn":"Plato+-+Complete+Works+%28John+M.+Cooper%2C+ed.%29+-+Hackett+Publishin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"286b3157b7d11b98c3c3948e8124786c45bf1486","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,107,49,87,183,209,27,152,195,195,148,142,129,36,120,108,69,191,20,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
