Lovecraft (1890-1937), one of the early 20th century's masters      \n    of gothic-horror literature. The film offers an encounter with           \n    Lovecraft and enters into his world. Engaging in a kind of game          \n    around the writer, the film playfully winks at some of the themes        \n    characteristic of his work: the occult, cursed books, monstrous          \n    creatures. Out of Mind draws its inspiration from Lovecraft's            \n    personal correspondence and many of his stories, carrying the viewer     \n    through a labyrinth &quot;beyond the wall of sleep.&quot;                          \n                                                                             \n    Cheers NOD team!                                                         \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
