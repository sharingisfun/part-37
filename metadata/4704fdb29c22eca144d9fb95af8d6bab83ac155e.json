Divided into\nthree sections it addresses morphing aircraft, bio-inspiration\nand smart structures with specific focus on the flight control\naerodynamics, bio-mechanics, materials, and structures of these\nvehicles as well as power requirements and the use of advanced\npiezo materials and smart actuators. The tutorial approach\nadopted by the contributors, including underlying concepts and\nmathematical formulations, unifies the methodologies and tools\nrequired to provide practicing engineers and applied researchers\nwith the insight to synthesize morphing air vehicles and morphing\nstructures, as well as offering direction for future research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4704fdb29c22eca144d9fb95af8d6bab83ac155e","amp;dn":"WILEY.MORPHING.AEROSPACE.VEHICLES.AND.STRUCTURES.2012.RETAIL.EBO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4704fdb29c22eca144d9fb95af8d6bab83ac155e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,4,253,178,156,34,236,161,68,217,251,149,175,141,107,171,131,172,21,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
