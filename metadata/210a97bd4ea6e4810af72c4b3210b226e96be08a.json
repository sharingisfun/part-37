Though he long ago lost his ability to taste, Martin still lives to cook incredibly lavish dinners for his loved ones and to serve them in a family-style ritual at traditional sit-down meals. Although the women humor their father's old-fashioned ways, each of them is searching for fulfillment outside the family circle. College student Maribel is growing increasingly frustrated with the singles scene and wants a steady man; gorgeous career woman Carmen is fed up with her boyfriend and his wandering eye; meanwhile, eldest daughter Letitia, who has suppressed her own romantic longings, senses something missing in her life. Things take a turn for the romantic when Dad, a widower, meets a vivacious divorcee on the lookout for a mate and each of his daughters, in turn, finds someone. But they'll all discover that the recipe for happiness may call for some unexpected...\n\nIMDb Rate: 6.5/10\nIMDb Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255653/\n\nMedia Information\n\nSize: 700 MB\nFormat: AVI\nVideo: XviD | 640x464 | 810 Kbps | 23.976 FPS | 1.379\nAudio: English | 122 Kbps | 2 ch | MP3\nRuntime: 103 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:210a97bd4ea6e4810af72c4b3210b226e96be08a","amp;dn":"Tortilla.Soup.2001.DVDRip.XviD-MULTiPLY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"210a97bd4ea6e4810af72c4b3210b226e96be08a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,10,151,189,78,166,228,129,10,247,44,75,50,16,178,38,233,107,224,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
