It's epic, ambitious and imaginific as Gabriel-era Genesis, with an exquisite sake for beautiful, mellow melodies, but it is also as eerie, moody and decadent as The Cure. The songs are incredibly sad, not properly desperate but resigned, yet at some point they &quot;open&quot; into major-key sections which deliver some hope, just the amount you need to miss it and feel melancholic afterwards. The vocals are excellent, they are dramatic and expressionist but never exaggerated or artificious: singer Geoff Mann doesn't have to fear comparisons with Peter Gabriel or Peter Hammil, placing somewhere between the two but with a unique and very personal style. The overall sound is focused on creating decadent atmospheres, with prominent six-string bass work and early-80s synths depicting eerie textures instead of taking the scene with solos.  \n\nTwelfth Night: Formed February 23, 1978, Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom \nMembers Andy Revell (guitar), Brian Devoil (drums), Geoff Mann (vocals, 1981-83), Clive Mitten (bass, keyboards, 1978-87, 2007-present), Rick Battersby (keyboards, 1978-87), Electra McLeod (vocals, 1980), Andy Sears (vocals, 1983-86, 2007-present), Martyn Watson (bass, vocals, 1987), Mark Spencer (keyboards, guitar, 2007-present) \n\n1 We Are Sane    \n2 Human Being    \n3 This City    \n4 World Without End    \n5 Fact and Fiction    \n6 The Poet Sniffs a Flower    \n7 Creepshow    \n8 Love Song    \n Bonus Tracks    \n9 East of Eden    \n10 Eleanor Rigby    \n11 Constant (Fact and Fiction)    \n12 Fistful of Bubbles    \n13 Leader    \n14 Dancing in the Dream    \n15 Human Being (Alternate)    \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b30b636864f06aafbca3eead6c3c129aecd5654","amp;dn":"Twelfth+Night+-+Fact+and+Fiction++%5B1982%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b30b636864f06aafbca3eead6c3c129aecd5654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,48,182,54,134,79,6,170,251,202,62,234,214,195,193,41,174,205,86,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
