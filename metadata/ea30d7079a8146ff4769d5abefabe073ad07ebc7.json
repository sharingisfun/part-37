Even the most\n cautious citizens and their best-guarded possessions are not safe from his\n reach.\n \n As an uprising emerges, Garrett finds himself entangled in growing layers of\n conflict. Lead by Orion, the voice of the people, the tyrannized citizens\n will do everything they can to claim back the City from the Baron's grasp.\n The revolution is inevitable. If Garrett doesn't get involved, the streets\n will run red with blood and the City will tear itself apart. \n\n Garrett never paid the price for anything. until now.\n\n                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                           \n\n 1.
