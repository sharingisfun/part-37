Originally labelled the &quot;Stosstruppe Adolf Hitler,&quot; they later became known as the SS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Schutz Staffeln, or &quot;protection squads.&quot; From these humble beginnings, the SS rose to a nominal strength of 38 divisions of over 800,000 men by 1945, representing a sizeable portion of Germany's land forces and more importantly a quarter of her tank forces and a third of her mechanised infantry.
