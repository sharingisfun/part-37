Adam Archer meets the alien entities known as the Cosmic Fetus Collective, who transform him into a cosmic being and instruct him in the uses of his new powers. Archer is sent back to Earth as the first human to be touched by universal enlightenment.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72dd3b1a5f34f4afed8b34af6fa56dd0f9c3bd26","amp;dn":"Godland+%28G%C3%83%C2%B8dland%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72dd3b1a5f34f4afed8b34af6fa56dd0f9c3bd26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,221,59,26,95,52,244,175,237,139,52,175,111,165,109,208,249,195,189,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
