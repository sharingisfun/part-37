The film is almost entirely composed of aerial shots of various places on Earth. It shows the diversity of life on Earth and how humanity is threatening the ecological balance of the planet. \r\n\r\nHome was filmed in various stages due to the expanse of the areas portrayed. Taking over eighteen months to complete the film, director Yann Arthus-Bertrand and a camera man, a camera engineer and a pilot flew in a small helicopter through various regions in over fifty countries. The filming was done using high-definition &quot;Cineflex&quot; cameras which were suspended from a gyro-stabilized sphere from rails on the base of the helicopter. These cameras, originally manufactured for army firing equipment, reduce vibrations helping to capture smooth images, which appear as if they had been filmed from crane arms or dollies. After almost every flight, recordings were immediately checked to ensure they were usable. After filming was complete, Besson and his crew had over 488 hours of footage to edit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e657ef886d58718897ce5f165d636e0e0945a1ed","amp;dn":"HOME+%282009%29+documentary+%5B1280x720%5D+English+sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e657ef886d58718897ce5f165d636e0e0945a1ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,87,239,136,109,88,113,136,151,206,95,22,93,99,110,14,9,69,161,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
