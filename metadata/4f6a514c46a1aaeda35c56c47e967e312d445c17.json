It was composed of Vital Information drummer Steve Smith, Tribal Tech guitarist Scott Henderson, and BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck and the Flecktones bassist Victor Wooten. The group released two albums before breaking up due to time constraints (the band was a side project for all three members). There is still some talk of a future reunion, but no official announcement has been made.\n\nThe band never played live, although Smith has performed with Henderson and Wooten on separate occasions.\n\nThe band's music is almost entirely instrumental, focused on virtuosic, free flowing soloing on top of a complex, solid groove. It is considered to be more on the rock end of the fusion spectrum.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f6a514c46a1aaeda35c56c47e967e312d445c17","amp;dn":"Vital+Tech+Tones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f6a514c46a1aaeda35c56c47e967e312d445c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,106,81,76,70,161,170,237,163,92,86,196,126,150,126,49,45,68,92,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
