During the course of the story we follow our hero as he attempts to single-handedly save the country from falling into the hands of a despot.\nWhen a funeral of a British spy is attacked, all the remaining spies are killed. Only one spy is left and is now Britain\\&amp;#039;s last hope. Johnny English (Atkinson) and his sidekick, Bough (Miller) have been assigned the case of investigating the theft of the British Crown Jewels. The prime suspect is a mysterious French entrepreneur, known as Pascal Sauvage (Malkovich).
