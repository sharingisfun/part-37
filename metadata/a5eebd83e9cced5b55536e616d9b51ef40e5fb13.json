The units also possess unique, dynamic physical properties. For example, vehicles move faster on hard soil than they would in sand. There are three parties in the game: the USA, Russia and Iraq. Each faction allows the player to select two campaigns, consisting of 5 missions on average. Each campaign begins and ends with a rendered film scene.
