Would you be a terrorist if you put that certain something in the government officials' drinking water? Can one be a terrorist with a substance the government says is harmless? The Cr6 Terrorist is a complex imperative in an unconventional telling. The style of this writing is, if one considers its synthesis of physical structures (letters/words/paragraphs) with artistic license, an embarkation on the novel genre. Most importantly, The Cr6 Terrorist is an expose' on the industrial pollutant hexavalent chromium (Cr6 or CrVI) that literally tells its story from the inside...out.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:badc2734d6c8ee242b658d49e190685905b13e60","amp;dn":"The+Cr6+Terrorist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"badc2734d6c8ee242b658d49e190685905b13e60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,220,39,52,214,200,238,36,43,101,141,73,225,144,104,89,5,177,62,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
