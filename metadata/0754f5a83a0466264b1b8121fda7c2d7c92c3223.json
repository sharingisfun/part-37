Management struggles and sundry other hindrances limited his output, but couldn't avert the Scot from releasing two legendary singles -- the Tarantino-ized &quot;Stuck in the Middle With You&quot; and the unforgettable &quot;Baker Street,&quot; the latter included on this record. Just a glimpse of John Patrick Byrne's cool cover art lets the listener know City to City houses Rafferty's day in the sun as he conquers the world one metropolis at a time, his guitar and amp in tow. Setting out in his apocalyptic &quot;Ark,&quot; each song radiates the confidence of a master craftsman cruising in his prime, constructing brilliant pop confections with top-flight support while awaiting the crunch of civilization. The dreamy reality check &quot;Baker Street&quot; rightfully remains one of the greatest cuts in pop history. Forever-lost B-side &quot;Big Change in Weather&quot; further demonstrates Rafferty was on a rare roll. Domestic valentine &quot;Right Down the Line&quot; snugly followed to the height of the charts, and third release, &quot;Home and Dry,&quot; while not of an immortal status, stands as a quality song. He even stomps out a smooth hoedown on the title track. Rafferty's turns of phrase and tight composition skills create a fresh sound and perspective all his own. Any diverse style (and he attempts many) filters through his unique mindset, resulting in a classic platter buoyed by many moments of sheer genius. &quot;Whatever's written in your heart, that's all that matters.&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0754f5a83a0466264b1b8121fda7c2d7c92c3223","amp;dn":"Gerry+Rafferty+-+City+to+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0754f5a83a0466264b1b8121fda7c2d7c92c3223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,84,245,168,58,4,102,38,75,27,129,33,253,167,194,215,201,44,50,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
