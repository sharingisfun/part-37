In this short book, he provides readers with a fictional account of how a real, new medical technology could revolutionize the future of medicine by curing with sound. \r\n\r\nTHE TUMOR follows the present day experience of the fictional patient Paul, an otherwise healthy 35-year-old father who is diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Grisham takes readers through a detailed account of Paulâ€™s treatment and his familyâ€™s experience that doesnâ€™t end as we would hope. Grisham then explores an alternate future, where Paul is diagnosed with the same brain tumor at the same age, but in the year 2025, when a treatment called focused ultrasound is able to extend his life expectancy. \r\n\r\nFocused ultrasound has the potential to treat not just brain tumors, but many other disorders, including Parkinsonâ€™s, Alzheimerâ€™s, hypertension, and prostate, breast and pancreatic cancer. \r\n\r\nFor more information, you can visit The Focused Ultrasound Foundationâ€™s website. Here you will find a video of Grisham on the TEDx stage with the Foundationâ€™s chairman and a Parkinsonâ€™s patient who brings the audience to its feet sharing her incredible story of a focused ultrasound â€œmiracle.â€ \r\n\r\nReaders will get a taste of the narrative they expect from Grisham, but this short book will also educate and inspire people to be hopeful about the future of medical innovation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc49ed67c3235501f6bc6fc1564b548e782d1cfe","amp;dn":"The+Tumor+-+A+Non-Legal+Thriller+BY+John+Grisham","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc49ed67c3235501f6bc6fc1564b548e782d1cfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,73,237,103,195,35,85,1,246,188,111,193,86,75,84,142,120,45,28,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
