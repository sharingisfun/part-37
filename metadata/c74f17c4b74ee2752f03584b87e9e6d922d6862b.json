Today, it has grown into South Asia's most popular electronics magazine. In fact, the name 'EFY' Group has been coined from the abbreviation of this magazine's title. The magazine's goal is to keep the electronics fraternity updated with the latest technical knowledge. It also keeps hobbyists busy with the circuit ideas and construction projects it carries month after month. And it helps end users decide on which electronic product to buy when they enter a shopping mall.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c74f17c4b74ee2752f03584b87e9e6d922d6862b","amp;dn":"Electronics+For+You+-+July+2013.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c74f17c4b74ee2752f03584b87e9e6d922d6862b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,79,23,196,183,78,226,117,47,3,88,75,135,233,230,217,34,214,134,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
