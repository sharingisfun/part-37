We discover math's signature in the swirl of a nautilus shell, the whirlpool of a galaxy, and the spiral in the center of a sunflower. Math was essential to everything from the first wireless radio transmissions to the prediction and discovery of the Higgs boson and the successful landing of rovers on Mars. Astrophysicist and writer Mario Livio, along with a colorful cast of mathematicians, physicists, and engineers, follow math from Pythagoras to Einstein and beyond. It all leads to the ultimate riddle: Is math a human invention or the discovery of the language of the universe?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db43818031e6d17cd4fd002f2f16fcb32d793943","amp;dn":"PBS.NOVA.The.Great.Math.Mystery.WebRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db43818031e6d17cd4fd002f2f16fcb32d793943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,67,129,128,49,230,209,124,212,253,0,47,47,22,252,179,45,121,57,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
