Somehow she consorted with Jimi Henrix, who invited her to attend Woodstock with him. For some reason she declined and never cracked the commercial ceiling.\r\n\r\nHer talents were sufficient that the producer (Mike Vernon-who produced the 'Beano' Bluesbreaker album with Mayall/Clapton) managed to recruit no only Clapton....BUT also Paul Kossoff, and even Jimmy Page. But due to a prior commitment, Page could not make the recording sessions. Clapton and Kossoff however did...and you can easily hear their unmistakeable contributions. \r\n\r\nCheck out THESE credits for instance\r\nPersonnel:\r\nMartha Velez - Vocals\r\n+\r\nGuitar - Eric Clapton, Stan Webb, Paul Kossoff, Rick Hayward, Spit James\r\nBass - Jack Bruce, Andy Silvester\r\nDrums - Jim Capaldi, Mitch Mitchell, Dave Bidwell,\r\nKeyboards - Christine McVie, Blue Weaver\r\nOrgan - Brian Auger\r\nSaxophone - Johnny Almond, Chris Mercer, Chris Wood\r\nHorn - Jeff Condon, Terry Noonan, Bud Parkes, Derek Wadsworth\r\nHarmonica - Duster Bennett\r\n\r\nThe end result fully lives up to the sum of its parts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82eb60eebed77e31725882b5ff0cc2f1545c7852","amp;dn":"Martha+Velez-Fiends+and+Angels%3B+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82eb60eebed77e31725882b5ff0cc2f1545c7852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,235,96,238,190,215,126,49,114,88,130,181,255,12,194,241,84,92,120,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
