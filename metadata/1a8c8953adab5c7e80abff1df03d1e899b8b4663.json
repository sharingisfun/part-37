Sarah uses satellites 383 miles above the earth to spot ruins as small as 30cm buried beneath the surface. As Sarah searches for Viking sites from Britain to America, Dan explores how they voyaged thousands of miles when most ships never left the shoreline. He also tracks their expansion west, first as raiders and then as settlers and traders throughout Britain and beyond to Iceland and Greenland. In North America they excavate what could be the most westerly Viking settlement ever discovered","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8c8953adab5c7e80abff1df03d1e899b8b4663","amp;dn":"The+Vikings+Uncovered+EN+SUBS+x264+WEBRIP+MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8c8953adab5c7e80abff1df03d1e899b8b4663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,140,137,83,173,171,92,126,128,171,255,29,240,61,30,137,155,139,70,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
