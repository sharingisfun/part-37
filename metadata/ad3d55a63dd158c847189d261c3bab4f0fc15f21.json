It comes as close as any album could to bisecting electric blues and big-band jazz, using nearly two-dozen horn players (though not at the same time) in addition to a core rhythm section. Sometimes it's in the ballpark of B.B. King and Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland's jazziest, more swinging material, but it's more indebted to big-band sounds than either of those legends are. As a singer and arranger, Gaines puts the accent on suave elegance, mixing originals with tunes popularized by the likes of Nat King Cole and Louis Jordan. &quot;Route 66,&quot; also covered here, is perhaps an unimaginative selection considering how often it's been interpreted. As compensation, the instrumental cover of Michael Jackson's &quot;Rock with You&quot; is easily the album's most unconventional effort. The songs and vocals are more amiable than penetrating -- he's certainly less ruffled by &quot;Rats in My Kitchen&quot; than most players would be -- but it's a solid collection, impeccably constructed and performed without getting overly slick.
