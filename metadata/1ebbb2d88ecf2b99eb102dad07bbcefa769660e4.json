Each chapter follows a different guy (Mr. 72, Mr. 137, and Mr. 600), as well as Sheila, the female wrangler who dictates who is the next to be filmed with Cassie Wright. As the three men wait, each starts to divulge their true reasons for wanting to be filmed, as well as discuss the sordid history of Cassie Wright and her reason for suddenly dropping out of the pornography industry for a year. As backgrounds, secrets, and would-be children start to appear, the tensions in the room start to rise and in the end the true secrets of her comeback, and who really is Cassie Wright&amp;#039;s porn child, are the last things any of them suspect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ebbb2d88ecf2b99eb102dad07bbcefa769660e4","amp;dn":"Chuck+Palahniuk+-+Snuff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ebbb2d88ecf2b99eb102dad07bbcefa769660e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,187,178,216,142,207,43,153,235,16,45,173,7,187,206,250,118,150,96,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
