Never before has the simple undulation of a string conveyed such complex emotion.  First is the first to express the &quot;true self&quot; through music, and in doing so gives the listener a glimpse of the naked human soul, an experience so overwhelming and awe-inspiring that it is difficult not to release your bowels in a fit of confused, raw, whirlwind emotion.  \n\nSo throw on a heavy duty trashbag and prance to the light-hearted &quot;Barefoot Jig&quot;, go underwater to discover a magical world in &quot;The Mermaid&quot;, have just what the doctor ordered in &quot;Medicine Bow&quot;, and meet God herself in &quot;Katherine's Lament&quot;.  Happy listening!\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. The Island of Woods (3:05)\n2. Frost is Over/Barefoot Jig/Out in the Ocean (3:07)\n3.
