With this album, the band moved away from the hard-driving beat music style of 1964/65, which had catapulted them to international stardom. It was the first Kinks album consisting entirely of Ray Davies compositions. Deluxe version has Mono version of album on disc 1 [tracks 1-14] + bonus tracks and Stereo version of album on disc 2 [tracks 1-14] + additional bonus tracks.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDeluxe Edition - Disc 1\n\n01.  \t&quot;Party Line&quot;   \t2:35\n02. \t&quot;Rosie Won't You Please Come Home&quot;   \t2:34\n03.  \t&quot;Dandy&quot;   \t2:12\n04. \t&quot;Too Much on My Mind&quot;   \t2:28\n05.  \t&quot;Session Man&quot;   \t2:14\n06.  \t&quot;Rainy Day in June&quot;   \t3:10\n07.  \t&quot;A House in the Country&quot;   \t3:03\n08.  \t&quot;Holiday in Waikiki&quot;   \t2:52\n09. \t&quot;Most Exclusive Residence for Sale&quot;   \t2:48\n10.  \t&quot;Fancy&quot;   \t2:30\n11. \t&quot;Little Miss Queen of Darkness&quot;   \t3:16\n12.  \t&quot;You're Lookin' Fine&quot;   \t2:46\n13.  \t&quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot;   \t3:36\n14.  \t&quot;I'll Remember&quot;   \t2:27\n15.  \t&quot;Dead End Street&quot;   \t3:24\n16.  \t&quot;Big Black Smoke&quot;   \t2:35\n17.  \t&quot;This Is Where I Belong&quot;   \t2:27\n18. \t&quot;She's Got Everything&quot;   \t3:11\n19. \t&quot;Little Miss Queen of Darkness&quot; (alternative take) \t3:22\n20. \t&quot;Dead End Street&quot; (early acetate version) \t2:56\n\nDeluxe Edition - Disc 2\n\n01. \t&quot;Party Line&quot;   \t2:35\n02. \t&quot;Rosie Won't You Please Come Home&quot;   \t2:34\n03. \t&quot;Dandy&quot;   \t2:12\n04. \t&quot;Too Much on My Mind&quot;   \t2:28\n05. \t&quot;Session Man&quot;   \t2:14\n06. \t&quot;Rainy Day in June&quot;   \t3:10\n07. \t&quot;A House in the Country&quot;   \t3:03\n08. \t&quot;Holiday in Waikiki&quot;   \t2:52\n09. \t&quot;Most Exclusive Residence for Sale&quot;   \t2:48\n10. \t&quot;Fancy&quot;   \t2:30\n11. \t&quot;Little Miss Queen of Darkness&quot;   \t3:16\n12. \t&quot;You're Lookin' Fine&quot;   \t2:46\n13. \t&quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot;   \t3:36\n14. \t&quot;I'll Remember&quot;   \t2:27\n15. \t&quot;This Is Where I Belong&quot;   \t2:46\n16. \t&quot;Big Black Smoke&quot;   \t2:51\n17. \t&quot;She's Got Everything&quot;   \t3:10\n18. \t&quot;You're Looking Fine&quot; (alternative stereo mix) \t2:53\n19. \t&quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot; (alternative mix, no fade-out) 3:49\n20.  \t&quot;Fancy&quot; (alternative stereo mix, fade-out extended) 2:57\n21. \t&quot;Little Miss Queen of Darkness&quot; (alternative mix)  3:22\n22. \t&quot;Dandy&quot; (alternative stereo mix) \t2:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a83bdc528b4e43861b2ecee4ab1291674f4ed89f","amp;dn":"The+Kinks+-+Face+To+Face+%5BDeluxe%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a83bdc528b4e43861b2ecee4ab1291674f4ed89f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,59,220,82,139,78,67,134,27,46,206,228,171,18,145,103,79,78,216,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
