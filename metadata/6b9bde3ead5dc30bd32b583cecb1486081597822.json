I discovered Lohan after hearing a song she did for the &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; soundtrack.  After hearing Lohan for the first time, I had to go out and find ANYTHING by her and I found &quot;No Mermaid.&quot;  Some of you may recall that she had a slight hit in 1998 with &quot;Whatever It Takes,&quot; but it isn't that one song that makes this a great cd, in my opinion anyway.  &quot;No Mermaid&quot; was produced by Malcolm Burn at his Clouet Street Studio in New Orleans.  Burn and Daniel Lanois have worked together in the past and in fact, many of the songs on this 1998 release have an ethereal and hypnotic\nquality reminscent of Lanois and Burn's collaberative efforts. &quot;Hot On Your Trail,&quot; &quot;Don't I Know,&quot; &quot;What Can Never Be,&quot; and &quot;Loose Ends&quot; really stand out.  But really, I love the entire cd.  (Please note, a couple of the tracks were produced with a scratchy record effect.. it's not the cd.)\n\nIf you like this, leave a message.  I also have an EP/CD with 3 live songs and several other gems by Lohan that were released as part of various compilations.  Additionally, I have her first cd, &quot;Who Do You Think I Am,&quot; in mp3 format (320 kbps.)  &quot;Who Do You....&quot; is a more folksy type work but it is quite good. \n\nRipped to flac using EAC.
