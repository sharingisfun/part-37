Looking at the Western world's major figures and moments, yet focusing on the small details of daily life, Rossellini was determined not to recount history but to relive it, as it might have been, unadorned and full of the drama of the everyday. This selection of Rossellini's history films presents The Age of the Medici, Cartesius and Blaise Pascal - works that don't just enliven the past but illuminate the ideas that have brought us to where we are today.\n\nDVD Source: Eclipse from Criterion DVD9 \nDVD Format: NTSC \nProgram: DVD Decrypter \n\nMenus: Untouched \nVideo: Untouched \nAudio: Untouched \nDVD extras: None\n\nAÃƒÂ±adidos los subtÃƒÂ­tulos en espaÃƒÂ±ol hechos por hottier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:312275e2fde52130c98ec1596de27a0f904f57d7","amp;dn":"Cartesius+%28Roberto+Rossellini+%2C1974%29+Criterion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"312275e2fde52130c98ec1596de27a0f904f57d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,34,117,226,253,229,33,48,201,142,193,89,109,226,122,15,144,79,87,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
