Tom Fuller (Mark Moses) is a computer whiz who is under investigation by the FBI, who suspect he may be the man behind a dangerous piece of underground software that would allow terrorists and criminals to access secured intelligence files online. The Bureau is looking for a way to get inside Fuller&amp;#039;s home to find out what he&amp;#039;s doing when a golden opportunity presents itself -- Fuller and his wife, Leah (Emily Procter), are in the market for a nanny to help look after their three children. The FBI sends in Malcolm Turner (Martin Lawrence), who will once again impersonate feisty septuagenarian Hattie Mae Pierce, better known as &quot;Big Momma.&quot; &quot;Big Momma&quot; gets the job, but while trying to dig up the truth about Fuller&amp;#039;s possible criminal connections, Malcolm also finds himself developing a close relationship with the suspect&amp;#039;s wife and kids. Malcolm also finds himself offering unlikely romantic advice to his new partner, Kevin (Zachary Levi), and developing a new appreciation of the day-to-day travails of his wife, Sherrie (Nia Long). ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide\n\n\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 99 mins \nComplete Cast:\nMartin Lawrence - Malcolm / Big Momma\nEmily Procter - Leah Fuller\nMark Moses - Tom Fuller\nChloÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Grace Moretz - Carrie\nJosh Flitter - Stewart\nLisa Anderson - Danielle\nWilliam Ragsdale - Bob\nRoland &quot;Bob&quot; Harris - Old Guy\nWendy Braun - Coach Bonnie\nMarcus Brown - Erskine\nSean Lampkin - Cabbie\nKirk B.R.
