John wrote the song about a down and out musician playing a gig in Lodi, which is a small agricultural city located in the Central Valley of California. John claimed that he thought Lodi had Ã¢â‚¬Å“the coolest sounding nameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what inspired him to use it in the song. John was from our neighborhood, born in Berkeley, Ca.-which is about 70 miles from Lodi, and he went to El Cerrito High School. Growing up in the East Bay, coming from a working class family, Creedence was the Holy Grail of what we consider great, and cool about music.\n \nWritten by John Fogerty\n \nTim Timebomb- Vocals, Guitar\nJames Doyle-Drums\nBrett Simons- Bass\nHunter Perrin- Guitar\nJohn Morrical- Piano\nKevin Bivona-B3, Background Vocals, and Tambourine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b4833cebbc81ba48582cb96043ec840ecb8cd7","amp;dn":"Lodi+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b4833cebbc81ba48582cb96043ec840ecb8cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,180,131,60,235,188,129,186,72,88,44,185,96,67,236,132,14,203,140,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
