A friendly greeting where we pretend to know each other well and are genuinely happy to see each other; then straight to business. None of it meaningful. None of it real. All of it rehearsed, choreographed, and expected.\nMy life isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t my own anymore. I pretty much go wherever IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m told and put on the show. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my life and whether I chose it or not, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the life IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the world I live in.\nAnd, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m searching. Always searchingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what for.\n\nCab Stone has it allÃ¢â‚¬â€fame, fortune and the adoration of millions of women across the globe. When the constant attention from fans and expectations from his handlers becomes too much, he escapes the craziness of press junkets and movie sets and escapes to Asheville, North Carolina to hide away for the summer.\nHe expects peace, quiet, and solitude. What he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect is to meet a fiery redhead who changes everything he knows about the world.\nThe daughter of missionaries, Kei Sallee lives a life of service to others. She has little, expects less, and helps heal the hearts of thousands in Uganda, where she grew up. When she finds herself staying in the same guesthouse as Cab Stone, she vows to ignore his Greek god good looks and spend the summer as she had plannedÃ¢â‚¬â€in peace, quiet, and solitude.\nCab and KeiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be more differentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or more the same.\nDespite, or perhaps because of, their vastly different yet startlingly similar backgrounds, Cab and Kei strike up an unlikely friendship that could possibly blossom into something more. But Kei fears that the truth about her past will prevent pretty-boy Cab, who is used to getting everything he wants, from fully committing to her.\n\nWhen two completely different worlds experience a Collision, can they exist as one?\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5ac44b41bedbc97b32ee5f8c13b5fcda1b5c70","amp;dn":"Collision+-+Miller%2C+Stefne+%28Epub%2BMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5ac44b41bedbc97b32ee5f8c13b5fcda1b5c70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,90,196,75,65,190,219,201,123,50,238,95,140,19,181,252,218,27,92,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
