The film documents the difficult recording period, the band members' relationships, and the record's legacy. Archival footage and stills from the recording sessions appear in the film, along with unreleased scenes from the group's 1988 motion picture Rattle and Hum. For the documentary, the band were filmed during a return visit to Hansa Studios where the album was recorded, and during rehearsals in Winnipeg for the Glastonbury Festival 2011.\n\ntrailer:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32d879b7edf576d4720dd406b2f5f4d2b39bf5dd","amp;dn":"U2+From+The+Sky+Down+documentarty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32d879b7edf576d4720dd406b2f5f4d2b39bf5dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,216,121,183,237,245,118,212,114,13,212,6,178,245,244,210,179,155,245,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
