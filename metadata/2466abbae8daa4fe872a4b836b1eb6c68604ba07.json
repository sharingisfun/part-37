Cardiants style has been described as power metal or heavy rock (someone even calling it AOR!). Cardiant recorded its debut album Midday Moon in 2005. At that time band didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a permanent singer and was forced to have Janne Saksa as a session singer on the album. Unfortunately Underground Symphony had problems with the European release and the album was released only in Japan by Marquee/Avalon.\n\n In years 2007 and 2008 Cardiant had some line-up changes when Mikko, Marko and Erik joined the band. In 2009 Cardiant recorded its second, self-financed album TomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daylight.\n\n In 2010 Cardiant was selected to the semi-finals of Finnish national selection for Eurovision 2011 from amongst a group of 277 participants. Cardiant was voted to the finals along with nine other performers. The same year Cardiant also composed and recorded the theme and entrance song for Finnish ice-hockey team Tappara.\n\n The third album Ã¢â‚¬Å“VergeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be released in May 2013 by Marquee Avalon (Japan) and Inverse Records (Europe). Outi Jokinen joined the band in 2012 as a backing vocalist and along with the backing vocals, she also has lead parts on the new album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2466abbae8daa4fe872a4b836b1eb6c68604ba07","amp;dn":"CARDIANT+discography+%282001-2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2466abbae8daa4fe872a4b836b1eb6c68604ba07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,102,171,186,232,218,164,254,135,42,75,131,107,30,182,198,134,4,186,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
