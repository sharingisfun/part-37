Some of these are reworked from single show torrents put out by others, so major props to them! There is also a large grab bag of assorted songs from lots of other shows, but in those cases I couldn?t find the entire score. I have maybe another 50 shows on tape or record, but no means of making quality mp3s out of them. One or two shows are missing a song that I just couldn?t find.\n\nFor other collectors out there like myself, I think we are making this harder on ourselves than it needs to be. The searchable tags need to be much better. Titles should always have something like BROADWAY or STANDUP COMEDY instead of just obscure names or TLAs like ?OBC? (and should NOT be in FLAC format, you rotten *&amp;%$&amp;$!!!!). Put something down in the description field so people have a clue what they are getting and a reason to bother getting it! Anyway, Broadway newbies should like this collection, it has most of the best and the most famous shows ? although I would advise you to avoid everything by Rodgers and Hammerstein ? it?s vomit inducing schlock.\n\nFor all my fellow Broadway fans, please link to this torrent with any torrents for quality shows I have missed. I really wanted to add some that I just couldn?t find, or were only available on pay torrent sites. Together, we should be able to build a MAJOR Broadway resource. If anybody knows a good way for a technical idiot like me to get old tapes and LPs converted to mp3 without having to buy equipment, please link that too. Lastly, I have a mess of DVDs of Broadway shows performed in front of live audiences that I would love to share, but I don?t know how to rip DVDs, and all the how to manuals I have found online are written in techno geek or require me to buy equipment, so any simple advice for the technically impaired would be greatly appreciated!\n\nOne last note ? anything you could ever want to know about any show is here: http://www.nodanw.com/list_of_shows_index/titlepage.htm\n\nAnything Goes\n Avenue Q\n Barnum\n Camelot\n Chess - Original Broadway Cast\n Chess - Original London Cast\n Fiddler On The Roof\n A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum - 1996\n Guys And Dolls - 1992\n Hair\n Hedwig and the Angry Inch\n Into the Woods\n Joseph and the Amazing Dreamcoat\n Kristin Chenowith collection\n Les Miz\n Monty Python&amp;#039;s Spamalot\n My Fair Lady\n Once Upon a Mattress\n Phantom of the Opera\n Ragtime\n Rent\n Sweeney Todd 2005 Revival\n The Little Mermaid - Broadway Cast Recording 2008\n The Producers\n Unsinkable Molly Brown\n West Side Story\n Wicked\n\n AAA - Assorted songs - incomplete albums\n 42nd Street - Lullaby Of Broadway.mp3 (5.05 megabyte)\n A Chorus Line - One.mp3 (4.63 megabyte)\n Barbara Streisand - Funny Girl - My Man (1).mp3 (2.73 megabyte)\n Barbara Streisand - Second Hand Rose - Funny Girl.mp3 (2.97 megabyte)\n Barbershop - Give My Regards to Broadway.mp3 (3.29 megabyte)\n Barbershop-Shirley Jones, Robert Preston &amp; The Buffalo ~D07.mp3 (3.89 megabyte)\n Bernadette Peters (Rare) - In A Little While (from Once U~Bd.mp3 (1.99 megabyte)\n Betty Hutton &amp; Howard Keel - Anything You Can Do.mp3 (2.8 megabyte)\n Broadway Kids - Les Miz Medley (Les Miserables).mp3 (3.67 megabyte)\n Broadway Musicals - Gershwin - I Got Rhythm.mp3 (2.06 megabyte)\n Cabaret - Wilkommen .mp3 (4.13 megabyte)\n Chicago - All That Jazz.mp3 (3.49 megabyte)\n Chicago - Cell Block Tango.mp3 (4.29 megabyte)\n Chorus Line I Can Do That.mp3 (1.07 megabyte)\n Closing Medley (Do you hear the people sing - One Day More).mp3 (3.49 megabyte)\n Evita - Don&amp;#039;t Cry For Me Argentina.mp3 (2.53 megabyte)\n Gilbert &amp; Sullivan - A Policeman&amp;#039;s Lot Is Not A Happy One.mp3 (1.67 megabyte)\n Gilbert &amp; Sullivan - Go, Ye Heroes, Go To Glory.mp3 (3.11 megabyte)\n Gilbert &amp; Sullivan - Maiden Breast.mp3 (3.2 megabyte)\n Gilbert &amp; Sullivan - Modern Major - General.mp3 (2.2 megabyte)\n Gilbert &amp; Sullivan - Modern Major - General01.mp3 (2.06 megabyte)\n Gilbert &amp; Sullivan - Poor Wandering One.mp3 (2.02 megabyte)\n How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying - A Sec~510.MP3 (4.6 megabyte)\n How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying - Broth~150.MP3 (4.71 megabyte)\n How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying - How To....MP3 (1.46 megabyte)\n How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying - I Bel~F7E.MP3 (4.63 megabyte)\n How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying - The C~9F7.MP3 (3 megabyte)\n Little Shop Of Horrors - Dentist.mp3 (3.37 megabyte)\n Little Shop Of Horrors - Intro.mp3 (3.18 megabyte)\n Little Shop Of Horrors - Skid Row.mp3 (5.82 megabyte)\n Little Shop Of Horrors - Suddenly Seymore.mp3 (3.15 megabyte)\n Oliver Twist - I&amp;#039;d Do Anything.mp3 (3.46 megabyte)\n Oliver Twist - Oom - Pah - Pah (Other).mp3 (3.39 megabyte)\n Oliver Twist - Where Is Love.mp3 (2.79 megabyte)\n Oliver! - Who Will Buy.mp3 (4.12 megabyte)\n Roger Whitaker - Sunrise, Sunset.mp3 (3.02 megabyte)\n Roger Whittaker - The Impossible Dream.mp3 (1.89 megabyte)\n Show Tunes - Fiddler On The Roof - If I Were A Rich Man.mp3 (4.47 megabyte)\n Sweeny Todd - The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd (1).mp3 (2.71 megabyte)\n The Producers - Keep It Gay.mp3 (2.33 megabyte)\n You&amp;#039;re A Good Man, Charlie Brown - Glee Club Rehearsal.mp3 (1.34 megabyte)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cb9d2e39d9ba523455f52ae0464ba3581ddfd27","amp;dn":"Instant+Broadway+Musical+Collection+-+25+full+shows+plus+notes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cb9d2e39d9ba523455f52ae0464ba3581ddfd27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,185,210,227,157,155,165,35,69,95,82,174,4,100,186,53,129,221,253,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
