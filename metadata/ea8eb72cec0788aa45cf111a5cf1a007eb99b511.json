He shows off his tremendous chops in a roller coaster treatment of the bittersweet ballad &quot;You've Changed,&quot; then switches to a jaunty mood for a brisk treatment of &quot;It Could Happen to You.&quot; Wyboris kicks off the thunderous take of Jimmy Heath's &quot;Jimmy's Tempo,&quot; a passionate hard bop vehicle. But the primary focus of this CD consists of four original blues penned by the pianist. It seems likely that at least some of them were improvised on the date, though &quot;Blues for Coltrane&quot; seems to draw inspiration from the late tenor saxophonist's rapid-fire live solos that left little open space. &quot;Blues for Myself,&quot; the centerpiece of the release, seems closely related to &quot;You've Changed,&quot; though the chord progressions do vary. Released by the Spanish label Ensayo, this disc is worth acquiring.
