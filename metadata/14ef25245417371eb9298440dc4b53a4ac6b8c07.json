Based in part on Endgame, the best-selling book by Derrick Jensen, END:CIV asks: &quot;If your homeland was invaded by aliens who cut down the forests, poisoned the water and air, and contaminated the food supply, would you resist?&quot; Backed by Jensen's narrative, the film calls on us to act as if we truly love this land. The film trips along at a brisk pace, using music, archival footage, motion graphics, animation, slapstick and satire to deconstruct the global economic system, even as it implodes around us. END:CIV illustrates first-person stories of sacrifice and heroism with intense, emotionally-charged images that match Jensen's poetic and intuitive approach. Scenes shot in the back country provide interludes of breathtaking natural beauty alongside clearcut evidence of horrific but commonplace destruction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14ef25245417371eb9298440dc4b53a4ac6b8c07","amp;dn":"END%3ACIV+-+Resist+or+Die+-+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14ef25245417371eb9298440dc4b53a4ac6b8c07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,239,37,36,84,23,55,30,185,41,132,64,220,75,83,164,172,107,140,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
