The initial batch of songs I had written for this record had super-heavy bass and really dance-y drums, but then I started playing in Death From Above again and realized that I didn't need to do that with this album anymore, so it started moving more in this direction,&quot; explains Grainger.\n\nGrainger started working on this album three years ago, and decided to do it completely solo this time after feeling disillusioned about turning 30 while on the road with his band The Mountains. Life in a tour van was looking less and less appealing, and Grainger felt the need to do something on his own terms, without any particular expectations. He's not even sure he'll be playing the songs live, given how much of his schedule is devoted to DFA 1979 at the moment.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I'll tour, if the market demands it. I'm not going to go out there and push this album on people, but if they want to see it live, I will figure out how to do it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThankfully, Last Gang saw the advantage of Grainger releasing a solo album to satiate fans while DFA 1979 take their time recording their comeback album, and were happy to let him under-promote &quot;Yours To Discover.&quot;\n\n&quot;My priority in my career right now is Death From Above. Doing stuff on my own is fun, but it's super lonely. We're still working on the songs, and it's a labour of love. With that band, there is accountability. Accountability to each other, and to the legacy of the band. It's just great to see audiences excited about something. It's very stimulating.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f24aea095c39881040e5ee41c14dcd64329b5fb","amp;dn":"Sebastien+Grainger+-+Yours+To+Discover+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f24aea095c39881040e5ee41c14dcd64329b5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,36,174,160,149,195,152,129,4,14,94,228,28,20,220,214,67,41,181,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
