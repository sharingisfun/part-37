On June 30, Paul's advocacy group Campaign for Liberty announced that the FEC has launched a pair of investigations on the organization. &quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m writing to let you know that our success has its price, and that price right now is the wrath of the Obama Administration and its attack dogs at the Federal Election Commission,&quot; Campaign for Liberty said in press release. &quot;TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve already come after us in multiple cases, alleging that Campaign for Liberty has acted illegally merely by putting the candidates on the record and reporting their positions.&quot; Dr. Paul has numerous published articles and books, including End The Fed (2009), and The Revolution: A Manifesto (2008). Check out For Liberty: How the Ron Paul Revolution Watered the Withered Tree of Liberty, a DVD available at the Infowars Store. \n[2nd half of hour 4]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.campaignforliberty.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.campaignforliberty.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dailypaul.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dailypaul.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ronpaul.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ronpaul.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.house.gov/paul/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.house.gov/paul/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ronpaul.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ronpaul.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex also covers the news and takes calls.\n\n\n\nNOTE :: Alex announced today that beginning in the middle of July [the 12th?] he will be reducing his weekday shows from four hours to three hours. \n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
