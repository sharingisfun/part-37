Johnson always suspected that his father was different. Only as a teenager did he discover the truth: his father was a spy, one of the CIAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most trusted officers. At first the secret was thrilling. But over time Scott began to have doubts. How could a man so rigorously trained to deceive and manipulate simply turn off those skills at home? His father had been living a double life for so long that his lies were hard to separate from the truth.\nWhen Scott embarked on a career as a foreign correspondent, he found himself returning to many of the troubled countries of his youth. In the dusty streets of Pakistan and Afghanistan, amid the cold urbanity of Yugoslavia, and down the mysterious alleys of Mexico City, he came face to face with his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murky pastÃ¢â‚¬â€and his own complicity in it. Scott learned that his chosen profession was not so different from his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s: they both worked to gain peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trust and to uncover their secrets. The only difference was what they did with that information.\n\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, father and son found themselves on assignment in Afghanistan and the Middle East, one as a CIA contractor, the other as a reporter for Newsweek. Suddenly, an unsettled Scott was forced to keep his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret all over again. As their professional lives collided, Scott and his father inched toward a personal reckoning, struggling to overcome a lifetime of suspicion and deception.\n\nThe Wolf and the Watchman is a provocative, meditative account of truth and duplicity, of manipulation and loyalty. It is also a moving, intensely personal portrait of a bond between father and son that endured in the shadow of one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most secretive and unforgiving institutions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4f685401ce5d41941d4ffe40af66cb0dd293273","amp;dn":"The+Wolf+and+the+Watchman%3A+A+Father%2C+a+Son%2C+and+the+CIA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4f685401ce5d41941d4ffe40af66cb0dd293273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,246,133,64,28,229,212,25,65,212,255,228,10,246,108,176,221,41,50,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
