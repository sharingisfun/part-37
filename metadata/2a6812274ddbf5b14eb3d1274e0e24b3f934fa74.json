We?ve rented or bought videos. We?ve giggled at YouTube. And we watch cable TV. And like you, we?ve sat on the couch thinking, ?There?s nothing on.?\n\nWe?re lazy. Getting up off the couch to go to a store that may or may not have something to watch is not lazy-friendly. Waiting a couple of days to download something off a filesharing service isn?t fun either. By then you might not be bored anymore.\n\nSo what are we supposed to do? All we want is a way to sit around, and when we feel like it, fire up something to watch that?s interesting, high quality transmission, and starts right NOW.\n\nEnter Graboid.\n\nWe know there?s lots of video content on the net, and most of it is inaccessible (meaning hard-to-get-for-lazy-people). So we figured out a way to get it and watch it easily. Ta daaaa. And we were so damned pleased with ourselves that we figured we?d share it. Yeah yeah, nobody?s an altruist, except maybe that Craigslist guy, so we do charge for some of our services. But we give you free stuff (GOOD free stuff) too.\n\nIt costs us money to provide this service to you, so be aware that even on the free stuff, we?re taking a hit. But we?re a little company up in Canada that wants to make the world a better place. Enjoy Graboid. We had fun making it. You?ll have fun using it.\n\nFeatures\n\nStreaming Video Playback\nInstant access to over 130,000 videos \nFull-resolution, full-length files \nForget BitTorrent, Graboid Video features little-to-no waiting for video playback \nDownloading\nDownload any video in our database for viewing or burning later \nHigh-definition video files are available \nMax-out your connection with the fastest download speeds anywhere \nIntegrated Playback\nPlay video files directly within the application \nFull-screen, high-resolution playback \nCrystal-clear digital audio \nFull Web Integration\nView details on your favorite videos directly within Graboid Video \nParticipate in discussions and get support with built-in community forums \nManage your account details without ever leaving Graboid Video \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6812274ddbf5b14eb3d1274e0e24b3f934fa74","amp;dn":"Graboid+Video+Downloader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6812274ddbf5b14eb3d1274e0e24b3f934fa74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,104,18,39,77,219,245,177,78,179,209,39,78,14,36,179,249,52,250,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
