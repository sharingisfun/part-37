What does the concept of Ã¢â‚¬Å“causalityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mean when we discuss higher psychological functions and behavior? Is it possible to generate Ã¢â‚¬Å“lawsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a psychological and behavioral scienceÃ¢â‚¬â€laws that go beyond statistical regularities, frequencies, and probabilities? An international group of authors compare and contrast the use of a causal model in psychology with a newer modelÃ¢â‚¬â€the catalytic model. The Catalyzing Mind: Beyond Models of Causality proposes an approach to the qualitative nature of psychological phenomena that focuses on the psychological significance and meaning of conditions, contexts, and situations as well as their sign-mediating processes. Contributors develop, apply, and criticize the notion of a catalyzing mind in hopes of achieving conceptual clarity and rigor. Disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, semiotics and biosemiotics are used for an interdisciplinary approach to the book. Research topics such as history and national identity, immigration, and transitions to adulthood are all brought into a dialogue with the concept of the catalyzing mind. With a variety of disciplines, theoretical concepts, and research topics this book is a collective effort at an approach to move beyond models of causality for explaining and understanding psychological phenomena.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Annals of Theoretical Psychology (Book 11)\nPDF: 307 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 2014 edition (December 2, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1461488206\nISBN-13:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:835c56808d6648689bd189d68619f7b9d3a68550","amp;dn":"The+Catalyzing+Mind%3A+Beyond+Models+of+Causality+%282013%29+Kenneth+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"835c56808d6648689bd189d68619f7b9d3a68550","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,92,86,128,141,102,72,104,155,209,137,214,134,25,247,185,211,166,133,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
