While Michael Feinstein stands out with his guest appearance on &quot;Baby, It's Cold Outside,&quot; LaMott remains the true star, thanks to her subtle, engaging arrangements, all of which make for a truly fine holiday album.\n\n&gt;&gt; If you like her work, please support her legacy by purchasing her CDs &lt;&lt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cdfeaccc259d6070a3daa47b3c69e8259269350","amp;dn":"Nancy+LaMott+-+Just+In+Time+For+Christmas+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cdfeaccc259d6070a3daa47b3c69e8259269350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,223,234,204,194,89,214,7,10,61,170,71,179,198,158,130,89,38,147,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
