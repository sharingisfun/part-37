But when his latest assignment (the seductive wife of a high-level Defense Department scientist) turns up in his best friend's bed, he is thrust into the underbelly of post atomic Los Angeles... where science is king and nothing is as it seems.  What follows is a night of back alley beatings, triplet Russian thugs, and... lightning shooting revoolvers?\n\nDames in the Atomic Age is a unique pulp tale that pays homage to the B-movies, sci-fi serials, and crime magazines of the 1940s and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ50s.\n\nThanks goes to Monafekk for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
