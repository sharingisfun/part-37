Vasilis became a member of the Klik Records&amp;#039; roster three years ago when he collaborated with Savvas Karampinos to release the project &amp;#039;Tales Beyond The Unknown&amp;#039; under the alias Acropod.  Yosebu started off as DJ when he was teenager, with drum&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;bass as their starting point.  Music and vinyl junky, he started DJing in clubs and open-air parties.Under the alias Yosebu he seldom presents his work in a live audience, like he did one year ago at the &amp;#039;Music Day Festival&amp;#039; or at the &amp;#039;Earth dance Festival&amp;#039; considering the fact that he speaks through music only when he&amp;#039;s got something to say! He avoids the &amp;#039;usual ways&amp;#039; having as a guiding force the sound itself.  As he says &quot;It&amp;#039;s very important to me the fact that the people who surround me are human like &quot;music encyclopedias&quot; and they show me musical ways I couldn&amp;#039;t even imagine! My greatest &amp;#039;kink&amp;#039; is finding new ways of putting more sounds into my ears.  Working with them, creating my own point of view!&quot;\n\nAfter two years in the studio working on his new project, Yosebu leaves for a while the atmospheric deep house music scene and presents on Monday the 19th Of November 2007 his new solo album &amp;#039;I Will Be Waiting Till Dawn&amp;#039;.  In his new project Yosebu uses the most appropriate sound engineering techniques in order to capture his warm sound in a CD.  The results create acoustic emotions that we have never experienced before.  Cinematic down tempo melodies that move fast like fire of notes.  Beautiful, eccentric, erotic compositions from Yosebu who manages to give us the music that lives inside his mind in a manner that escapes the standards of down tempo electronica.  A unique cocktail of guitars, samples and vocals to the point where electronic details meet orchestral music and move it to a higher level.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nTechnical characteristics:\nEncoder:  LAME v3.97\nSettings:  -V 2 --vbr-new\nEstimated bitrate:  192 kbps (VBR)\nStereo Mode:  Joint Stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a5efa3a0b730dc4f3dc8ff58a26d619dd1c0c21","amp;dn":"Yosebu+-+2007+-+I%5C%27ll+Be+Waiting+Till+Dawn+%5Bgreek+electronic+c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a5efa3a0b730dc4f3dc8ff58a26d619dd1c0c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,94,250,58,11,115,13,196,243,220,143,245,138,38,214,25,221,28,12,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
