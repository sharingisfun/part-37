You can't succeed, you can't be happy, you can't even be sad. You can't be anything.\n\nI never thought I would make it to my eighteenth birthday, I figured I'd be dead by then. I just wanted to make my mother happy, and I always knew the only way to succeed at that was by ceasing to exist.\n\nAnd then I met Chase. He saved me. From her, from myself, and in the end, from death.\n\nMy life was so dark and cloudy for so long, I never thought I would see the sun. But with Chase, they were merely clouds that were.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56549ba027d77926b1024f6d3527daeed894cee0","amp;dn":"%5BWeathered+Hearts+01%5D+Clouds+That+Were+by+Addison+Footit+%7Bdwg%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56549ba027d77926b1024f6d3527daeed894cee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,84,155,160,39,215,121,38,177,2,79,109,53,39,218,238,216,148,206,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
