I'm throwing in the subsequent crossover with 30 Days of Night since I didn't find it on TPB either! All credit goes to the original scanners! Please seed and share with our friends. --STFmaryville\n\n------\n\nTHE X-FILES\n\nTHE X-FILES lives on in this miniseries that serves as a &quot;lost&quot; season of the smash-hit TV series. Mulder and Scully are sent to San Francisco to solve a string of murders, then become targets of the Tong underworld and travel to the mysterious Badlands to investigate a series of disappearances in this title collecting THE X-FILES #0-6.\n\nWritten by: Doug Moench, Marv Wolfman, Frank Spotnitz\nPencilled by: Brian D Denham\nInked by: Brian D Denham\n\nColor\n\n------\n\nTHE X-FILES/30 DAYS OF NIGHT\n\nTwo of the most popular horror properties of the last two decades collide in this harrowing 6-issue adventure of epic proportions. Co-writers Steve Niles (writer and co-creator of 30 Days of Night) and rockstar-turned-writer Adam Jones (the band Tool) team with the amazing, moody artistry of industry legend Tom Mandrake (THE SPECTRE, BATMAN) to unleash the ultimate comics culture crossover.\n\nWhen evidence of a possible cannibal killer in Wainright, Alaska, draws the attention of the FBI, Agents Mulder and Scully draw the less-than-glamorous assignment. But all is not as it seems once the agents are on the ground. Not only has the long seasonal darkness begun to fall, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something unnatural about a few of the locals. And what does a chilling, mysterious black ship have to do with the murders?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d466ea708a72efe4262d5f4ef9786901f124bd9","amp;dn":"THE+X-FILES+%282008-09%29+and+X-FILES+30+DAYS+OF+NIGHT+%282010-11%29+Req","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d466ea708a72efe4262d5f4ef9786901f124bd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,70,110,167,8,167,46,254,66,98,213,244,239,151,134,144,31,18,75,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
