He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence. In so doing, he makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just irrational, but potentially deadly. Dawkins has fashioned an impassioned, rigorous rebuttal to religion, to be embraced by anyone who sputters at the inconsistencies and cruelties that riddle the Bible, bristles at the inanity of 'intelligent design', or agonizes over fundamentalism in the Middle East-or Middle America.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5308d245e917a9b3cd59da7c27116f8b3013ea6","amp;dn":"The+God+Delusion+Arabic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5308d245e917a9b3cd59da7c27116f8b3013ea6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,48,141,36,94,145,122,155,60,213,157,167,194,113,22,248,179,1,62,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
