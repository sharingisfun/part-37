The piano is Carmen. Or perhaps Don JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©? Drums and percussions play parts in a drama. Improvisers have always interpreted well-known melodies, trying to create a tension between the familiar and the new. Yet Carmen's blend of Spanish folk music and the popular song of the day - the aria - was a revolution in the world of music. I made my first recording of the Seguidilla ten years ago. The Toreador aria I had only just hummed. It was not until much later that I came up with the idea of interpreting the whole opera. The musical aspects of the opera sounded rather bombastic at first. The language of jazz felt alien. Yet Georges Bizet's Carmen somehow tempted me. I Wanted to move on with her. The secret lay in stricking a balance berween the grandiose opera form and the simple melodic line. So I Started humming the Toreador again... ~ Anders Widmark (from liner notes)\n\nPersonnel:\nAnders Widmark (Piano) - 2-12 \nLars Danielsson (Double Bass and Cello) - 1,5,7,9,10,12 \nJÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgen Stenberg (Marimba, Conga, Celesta, Whip, Timpani) - 2,3,5,6,8,9 \nBacka Hans Eriksson (Double Bass) - 2,3,6,8 \nLennart Gruvstedt (Drums) - 2,3,5,6,8-10,12 \nAnders Jonsson (Double Bass) - 12 \n\nAll compositions - by Georges Bizet \nArranged by Anders Widmark \n\nAnders Widmark - Carmen  tracks:\n01 Introduction 1:01 \n02 Song For A Toreador 4:11 \n03 Enter The Drums 3:23 \n04 Piano Interlude 1:19 \n05 Manuelita's Dream 4:27 \n06 Carmen's Choice 1:37 \n07 Away You'd Come With Me 2:50 \n08 Habanera Variations 4:49\n09 Intermezzo 2:22\n10 Seguidilla 3:56\n11 Gypsy Dance 3:33 \n12 Don JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© And Micaela 5:09","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf2e0de7cbe0a3b4bab11646fcd29381339f293","amp;dn":"Anders+Widmark+-+Carmen+%5BJazz+R%26P%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf2e0de7cbe0a3b4bab11646fcd29381339f293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,242,224,222,124,190,10,59,75,171,17,100,111,205,41,56,19,57,242,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
