Unfortunately after the fourth issue, changes in the comic distribution model made the book commercially unfeasible, which helped lead to BissetteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ultimate retirement from the comic industry in 1999. \n\nBissette has completed 40 pages of artwork, which would make up #5 and #6 and hopes to eventually publish a collection of all published and unpublished Tyrant material.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e5bc311ea34b9545377aa18ad83e4f19addafd4","amp;dn":"Tyrant+%28Steve+Bissette%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e5bc311ea34b9545377aa18ad83e4f19addafd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,91,195,17,234,52,185,84,83,119,170,24,173,131,228,241,154,221,175,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
