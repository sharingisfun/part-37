The band has a definite knack for tongue-in-cheek humor, and the weirder the better: the perfectly dark and hilarious &quot;Last Drink&quot; is among the group's best songs, with somber lyrics such as &quot;you were never big on conversation and that hasn't changed since your cremation.&quot; Other standouts include the guilt-ridden &quot;Oh Sorrow Oh Shame&quot; (the guilt associated with cross-dressing), the breezy and sunny &quot;Radios of Heaven&quot; and &quot;Truth Untold,&quot; a song reminiscent of the jangly and pleasant &quot;Sweetness and Love&quot; (from their second album, Bedbugs). The band segues into various moods with complete ease, but it seems like lyrics are a bit more important than music in this album -- some of the hooks and rhythms are too mundane to hold your attention. Overall, though, the hits on Good Weird Feeling are worth the misses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd287995c52195a0274860d112baaa13679eaeee","amp;dn":"Odds+-+Good+Weird+Feeling+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd287995c52195a0274860d112baaa13679eaeee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,40,121,149,197,33,149,160,39,72,96,209,18,186,170,19,103,158,174,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
