Ross Grimmett (AP, 1997).pdf\r\n\r\nImidazole and Benzimidazole Synthesis is a comprehensive survey of the known methods of syntheses and ring modification. It brings together the multitude of synthesis of the imidazole ring in a systemic way interms of specific bond formation, and recommends the most attractive synthetic approaches. It also collects non-ring-synthetic approaches to classes of compounds such as nitro-, halogeno-, and amino-imidazoles, and covers the synthesis of N-substituted compounds and preparations of specific isomers. \r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n* The only book in print dealing specifically with this topic\r\n* Comprehensive survey of the known methods of synthesis and ring modification\r\n* Recommends the most attractive synthetic approaches","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9e8550b2eeac9da50f2cbf17563c130bd262ace","amp;dn":"Imidazole+and+Benzimidazole+Synthesis+-+M.+Ross+Grimmett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9e8550b2eeac9da50f2cbf17563c130bd262ace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,232,85,11,46,234,201,218,80,242,203,241,117,99,193,48,189,38,42,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
