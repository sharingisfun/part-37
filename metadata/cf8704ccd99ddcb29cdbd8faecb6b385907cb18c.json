Even within portraiture, his style ranged from bold experiments to studied formality. And the subjects of his paintings were as varied as his styles, including the leaders of fashionable society, rural laborers, city streets, remote mountains, and the front lines of World War I. This beautiful book surveys and evaluates the extraordinary range of Sargent's work, and reproduces 150 of his paintings in color. It accompanies a spectacular international exhibition--the first major retrospective of the artist's career since the memorial exhibitions that followed his death","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf8704ccd99ddcb29cdbd8faecb6b385907cb18c","amp;dn":"John+Singer+Sargent+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf8704ccd99ddcb29cdbd8faecb6b385907cb18c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,135,4,204,217,157,220,178,156,219,216,250,236,182,179,133,144,124,177,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
