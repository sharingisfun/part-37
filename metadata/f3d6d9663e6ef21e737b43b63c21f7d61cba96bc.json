When Daniel Hackett sees his father Jonas gravely wounded by the villainous Stiles, his first urge is for his family to flee the danger, and give up their life on a farm which Daniel has come to despise anyway. Going alone to a lake to try to decide what to do, he falls asleep on a boat and wakes to find himself in the wild west, in the company of such &quot;tall tale&quot; legends as Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan, John Henry and Calamity Jane. Together, they battle the same villains Daniel is facing in his &quot;real&quot; world, ending with a heroic confrontation in which the boy stands up to Stiles and his henchmen, and rallies his neighbors to fight back against land grabbers who want to destroy their town.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3d6d9663e6ef21e737b43b63c21f7d61cba96bc","amp;dn":"Tall+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3d6d9663e6ef21e737b43b63c21f7d61cba96bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,214,217,102,62,110,242,30,115,123,67,182,60,33,247,214,28,186,150,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
