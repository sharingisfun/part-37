He was one of 10 children. The family moved from Wadesboro to Rockingham, NC, while Fulton was still a boy. It was there that he picked up most of his guitar skills. During the mid-1920s, he further developed his skills by playing on street corners and at house parties. It is reported that in 1926 he suffered from ulcerated eyes and became partially blind; by 1928 he was completely blind. There is another story that explains his blindness, though. Supposedly, a jealous woman, perhaps a girlfriend or ex-girlfriend, blinded him with a mixture of household chemicals. From around 1928 until the early 1930s, Fuller played anywhere he could, from tobacco warehouses to fish fries. He teamed up with Sonny Terry, a harmonica player, and sometimes Bull City Red and Gary Davis. He spent a lot of time recording with ARC label group from 1935 through 1938. He also recorded with numerous other record labels up until 1940. FullerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life began winding down at this time, as he underwent a kidney operation in 1940. It is unsure how he died, but two possible causes are blood poisoning due to the effects of his kidney operation and/or pneumonia. He died at his home in Durham, NC, and was buried in Grove Hill Cemetery. Fuller is remembered for his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcountryman compositions.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Many of his songs centered on the daily worries and woes of black tenant farmers and their encounters with big East Coast cities such as New York \n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
