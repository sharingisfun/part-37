One hundred years after his death, this magnificent new collection celebrates Verne's amazing vision. A host of today's top science fiction authors pay homage to Verne's genius with a series of stories inspired by his groundbreaking imagination and original characters. In this anthology are extraordinary voyages of discovery and adventure from the four corners of the globe, and even within it. Following the tradition of Verne's original tales, Ian Watson tells of a journey deep into the center of the Earth, where Verne himself does battle with occultist Nazis, and Adam Roberts takes us to latter-day California, where a descendant of Verne's character Hector Servadac is preparing for the end of the world as we know it. These and many more compelling adventures add up to an anthology that will introduce a new generation to the wonder of Jules Verne and delight readers already familiar with the master.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cfb71996ac7c772dc29e18294979ea201bd8f90","amp;dn":"The+Mammoth+Book+of+New+Jules+Verne+Adventures.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cfb71996ac7c772dc29e18294979ea201bd8f90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,251,113,153,106,199,199,114,220,41,225,130,148,151,158,162,1,189,143,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
