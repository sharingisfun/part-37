Sitting alone in a maximum-security prison cell, Abby Maddox is a celebrity. Her claim to fame is the envy of every freak on the outside: sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the former lover of Ethan Wolfe, the killer who left more than a dozen dead women in his wake and nearly added Puget Sound State professor Sheila Tao to the tally. Now Abby, serving a nine-year sentence for slashing a police officerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s throat in a moment of rage, has little human contactÃ¢â‚¬â€save for the letters that pour in from demented fans, lunatics, and creeps. But a new wave of murders has given Abby a possible chance for a plea bargainÃ¢â‚¬â€because this killer has been sending her love letters, and carving a message on the bodies of the victims: Free Abby Maddox.\n\nJerry Isaac will never forget the attackÃ¢â‚¬â€or his attacker. The hideous scarring and tortured speech are daily reminders that the one-time Seattle PD officer, now a private investigator, is just lucky to be alive. Abby Maddox deserves to rot in jailÃ¢â‚¬â€forever, as far as JerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concerned. But she alone may possess crucial evidenceÃ¢â‚¬â€letters from this newest killerÃ¢â‚¬â€that could crack open the disturbing case. With the help of Professor Sheila Tao, seasoned police detective Mike Torrance, and intuitive criminology student Danny Mercy, Jerry must coax the shattering truth from isolated, dangerous Abby Maddox. Can he put the pieces together before AbbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s number one fan takes another life in the name of a killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perverted idea of justice?\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - August 7th 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2025ccaa5930053fab7a7bfebf7e2642303761c0","amp;dn":"Freak+by+Jennifer+Hillier+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2025ccaa5930053fab7a7bfebf7e2642303761c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,37,204,170,89,48,5,63,171,122,123,254,191,126,38,66,48,55,97,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
