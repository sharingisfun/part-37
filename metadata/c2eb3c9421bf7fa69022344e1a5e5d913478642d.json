Did the resurrection really happen?  Is there any good evidence for it?  Can a strong case be made against it?\n\nThis series of videos was over a year in the making and covers\n\nsome things that I believe have not been discovered by anyone other than myself.  One in particular...\n\nan answer (finally) for why the author of the gospel of John did not include many of the scenes from\n\nthe synoptics and why there is a mystery disciple in many of those he did include.  I also cover information\n\nfrom Dennis R. MacDonald's book, &quot;The Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark&quot;.\n\nThese vids can be viewed on YouTube.  Just go to the TruthSurge channel and find it in the playlists or\n\ndo a search for the title on the main site.\n\n*****\n\nIf, after watching, you have enjoyed them or found them useful, consider supporting my efforts by\n\nvisiting www.surgingwithtruth.com/help_excavate.html\n\n*****\n\nFeel free to share these and make new torrents and copies!  There is no fee for these.\n\nTruth is not easy to find and we all contribute in our own ways.  These vids are simply my personal\n\nbeliefs that have congealed over time from a  sober examination of the evidences.  I've subtitled this\n\nseries &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;.   Hopefully, the evidence and arguments presented will at the very least cause you to think.\n\nThanks!\n\nTruthSurge\n\nHow to view:\n\n1) unrar\n\n2) use your favorite DVD burning software to burn the ISOs onto real DVDs or just mount the ISO and play\n\nusing your favorite software\n\nImage burning software to try:\n\nwww.imgburn.com \n\nRAR compression software to try:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwww.winrar.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2eb3c9421bf7fa69022344e1a5e5d913478642d","amp;dn":"Excavating+The+Empty+Tomb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2eb3c9421bf7fa69022344e1a5e5d913478642d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,235,60,148,33,191,127,166,144,34,52,78,26,94,93,145,52,120,100,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
