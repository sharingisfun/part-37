Size, position, even margins and padding can be altered with handles on the elements themselves. If the properties are stored in external CSS stylesheets, these are automaticaly updated.\n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d rather type your code, you can do that too. The objects you create in the Code Editor will appear on the page as soon as you stop typing, they can then be edited using the WYSIWYG display. \nFlux doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make a distinction between typed code, or objects created by Flux, you can create anyway you like, and Flux will understand. \nThe Flux Code Editor has syntax highlighting for HTML and CSS, auto-completion and line numbering.\n\nFlux can edit sites directly off an FTP or SFTP site, so you can make quick changes even quicker. All elements from a DIV to a PARAM to a CSS Rule can be edited in the Inspector. Flux supports Plugins, most CODA plugins work great in Flux.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.5 or later.\n\n---- PLEASE SEED ----","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb5146c02d1f4dd53875e959bc343051acc73601","amp;dn":"Flux+v.+3.2.62+with+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb5146c02d1f4dd53875e959bc343051acc73601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,81,70,192,45,31,77,213,56,117,233,89,188,52,48,81,172,199,54,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
