The Second Edition, designed as a learning tool for students who want to learn physical chemistry in a functional and relevant way, follows a traditional organization and now features an increased focus on thermochemistry, as well as new problems, new two-column examples, and a dynamic new four-color design. Written by a dedicated chemical educator and researcher, the text also includes a review of calculus applications as applied to physical chemistry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd5697a456313eb0c1cfc31d4227aa0b9845dfe1","amp;dn":"Physical+Chemistry+2nd+Ed+-+David+W.Ball.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd5697a456313eb0c1cfc31d4227aa0b9845dfe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,86,151,164,86,49,62,176,193,207,195,29,66,39,170,11,152,69,223,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
