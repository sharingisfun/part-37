I was brought up to earn it and not waste it, to respect and protect womanhood and promote manhood, and to be thankful for what you got. By today&amp;#039;s standard we ourselves, and most of the folks we knew, lived below the so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpoverty lineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. We were land and culture rich and dollar poor but I wouldn&amp;#039;t trade my upbringing for any other. I&amp;#039;ve always felt blessed to be raised here, to know so many larger than life characters, and to steep in the years of blood, sweat and the grim determination of my people before me. \n\n\nMy culture, life and love is here in this country ghetto.\n\n1) War \n(JJ Grey, Spook Ya Mule Music, BMI.)
