Our latest build greatly reduces that problem, if not out-right eliminating it. Thank you everyone who provided consistent feedback, which enabled us to finally repro this bug in house. This was one insanely tricky bugÃ¢â‚¬Â¦weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll share the gory ins and outs of it in a future Desktop Tuesday.\n\nAlong the way to fixing that key bug, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made hefty share of performance improvements and bug fixes. Here are the full patch notes.\n\nPatch Notes: release-240\nSpeed up the ambient-occlusion algorithm\nFix bug in the selection of doors, windows, and doodads in the building designer\nMake sure shop items are actually usable after they are purchased\nSignificant performance increases to nav-grid calculation (used by the pathfinder). The game should not longer hiccup when building roads or mining.\nProperly restore real-time timers on load (fixes zombie worker bug)\nFix demotion of the Shepherd\nFixes to calculation of water-tight regions (shhhh, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not supposed to know about water yet)\nFix for unexplored region being misplaced on load occasionally\nFix bug where job talismans were not properly assigned to their workshopsv0.1.0r223:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Increased logging infrastructure to help us better diagnose your automatic crash reports\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Flight permission on floating oak trees has been revoked\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Error boost::interprocess::bad_alloc should be eliminated, or at least very greatly reduced.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Clicks will no longer go Ã¢â‚¬Å“throughÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the UI and hit the game world when the game is not exactly 1.777:1 aspect ratio.

We think this may be an issue with GPU acceleration in our embedded browser. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve pushed a new build, (210) t hat may fix the problem.\nv0.1.0r206:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A flurry of bug fixes.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Your soldiers will now attack and open the goblin camp chest. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use the new loot command (in the harvest menu) to instruct your workers to grab the loot from the camp.\nv0.1.0 dev.2310:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fix a crash on game startup for Intel GPUs\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fix a crash on load.\nv0.1.0 dev.2307:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Lots of save/load bug fixes in this one, along with more tuning of the goblin campaign.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In particular, the goblins are far less interested in trifling settlements. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to build up a decent sized town before you attract their attention.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The goblins will wait for your town to be a little more developed before visiting you, and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t attack quite as frequently when they do attack\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Combat music now automatically plays when a hearthling seeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s danger\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Bug fix: on some systems the game would take several minutes to startup or load when there were many save games present\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Big fix: Goblins now grant experience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c2729490c45de440001f4fc7186d289d461e96f","amp;dn":"Stonehearth_v0.1.0+r240","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c2729490c45de440001f4fc7186d289d461e96f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,39,41,73,12,69,222,68,0,1,244,252,113,134,210,137,212,97,233,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
