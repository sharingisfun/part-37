The band originally featured lead singer Ronald &quot;Ronn&quot; (or &quot;Ron&quot;) Goedert, guitarist Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Richardson, keyboardist Hardin &quot;Buddy&quot; Pendergrass, drummer Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Shea and bassist Loyall &quot;Beau&quot; Fisher. Several of the band members had belonged to a popular late-60s Tampa-area band called The Tropics (band).[3]\n\nAfter touring small venues around the southeast for almost a year, White Witch signed with Capricorn Records, a label that included outfits such as the Allman Brothers Band and the Marshall Tucker Band. Though somewhat uneasy about being the only non-southern rock performers signed to the label, the members agreed to the contract without a manager or any legal representation and quickly recorded their self-titled debut album in Capricorn's Macon, Georgia studios. The band toured extensively to support the record, opening for established acts like Alice Cooper, Grand Funk Railroad, Billy Preston, and others.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7c8d7c1046c748111e2c62363b6d1aba0be950c","amp;dn":"White+Witch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7c8d7c1046c748111e2c62363b6d1aba0be950c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,200,215,193,4,108,116,129,17,226,198,35,99,182,209,171,160,190,149,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
