But it's the younger children -- aspiring ball player Russell; Hopalong Cassidy fan Norman; and straight-talking little Ruthie -- who struggle most with a bleak-looking future. Now, with their mother gone and their father, William, overwhelmed by the dismal economy and mounting doctor bills resulting from young Norman's battle with polio, the Kamp siblings fully expect a Christmas without presents or festivities. But when William scrapes together a dollar in coins to use only for Christmas gifts, everything begins to change.\n\nAs each member of the family comes up with a special gift that costs little or no money to be given to another member of the family, the Kamps soon begin to see many of their dearest wishes come true. And just when Norman and Ruthie believe their hopes and dreams are dashed, small miracles of service and sacrifice bring them joy and teach the true meaning of Christmas giving. Perhaps a boy who struggles to walk can become a real cowboy after all.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 15-Dec-2013\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nResolution: 640 x 362\nAspect ratio: 1.76796\nFormat: H264\nBitrate: 793 kbps\nFrames: 23.976 fps\nSelected codec: ff264\n\nAudio\nFormat: MP4A\nBitrate: 107 kbps\nRate: 48000 Hz\nChannels: 2\nSelected codec: ffaac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5022531caaff37389ff8fda69e9ac178393ccb70","amp;dn":"Christmas.For.a.Dollar.2013.UPtv.DSR.x264-W4F.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5022531caaff37389ff8fda69e9ac178393ccb70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,34,83,28,170,255,55,56,159,248,253,166,158,154,193,120,57,60,203,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
