This groundbreaking collection, the most thorough treatment of the philosophy of economics ever published, brings together philosophers, scientists and historians to map out the central topics in the field. The articles are divided into two groups. Chapters in the first group deal with various philosophical issues characteristic of economics in general, including realism and Lakatos, explanation and testing, modelling and mathematics, political ideology and feminist epistemology. Chapters in the second group discuss particular methods, theories and branches of economics, including forecasting and measurement, econometrics and experimentation, rational choice and agency issues, game theory and social choice, behavioural economics and public choice, geographical economics and evolutionary economics, and finally the economics of scientific knowledge. This volume serves as a detailed introduction for those new to the field as well as a rich source of new insights and potential research agendas for those already engaged with the philosophy of economics.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Economics-Handbook-Science-ebook/dp/B007ZC91U6/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Economics-Handbook-Science-ebook/dp/B007ZC91U6/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213be403472a0b895b9271ff3255c5b0b076a74a","amp;dn":"Philosophy+of+Economics+%282012+Handbook%29+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213be403472a0b895b9271ff3255c5b0b076a74a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,59,228,3,71,42,11,137,91,146,113,255,50,85,197,176,176,118,167,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
