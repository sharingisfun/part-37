However as mysterious as is this faction of bandits, there are other followers involved that are willing to combat the danger that remains shrouded within the darkness. If recovered safely into the hands of a trustworthy adventurer, the wine would prove to be of a truly vintage year. Gunsling and slice through a challenging set of randomly generated levels, filled with traps, enemies, weapons, bosses, and items to help you along the way. Decide a plan of action and light the way as you turn corners to engage in combat with multiple enemies at once. Throughout the game you can use the corks that you collect to purchase lanterns and new characters (including a custom character that you can create!). Level up and become more powerful, such as dealing poison damage or absorbing incoming damage, each with a visible effect on your character!&quot;\n\nVote for this game on Steam Greenlight:\n\nBuy the game on Desura: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/vintage-year&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/vintage-year&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8822b01abbf22938929231420a1a95e4d6ee401","amp;dn":"Vintage+Year+v2.5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8822b01abbf22938929231420a1a95e4d6ee401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,130,43,1,171,191,34,147,137,41,35,20,32,161,169,94,77,110,228,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
