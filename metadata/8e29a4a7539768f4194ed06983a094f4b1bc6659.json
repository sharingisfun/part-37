Before you can gobble up your dinner, you must track and take down your prey in various wooded environments including the eastern woodlands, Great Plains, and southwest landscapes. After finding a target, you can use a turkey call to lure it closure to your crosshairs. You may also save your scores in the Hunter's Log and see where you rank among other sportsmen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e29a4a7539768f4194ed06983a094f4b1bc6659","amp;dn":"Wild+Turkey+Hunt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e29a4a7539768f4194ed06983a094f4b1bc6659","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,41,164,167,83,151,104,244,25,78,208,105,131,160,148,244,177,188,102,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
