Jr. Palis, W. de Melo\n\n\nPublisher:   Springer\nNumber Of Pages:   198\nPublication Date:   1982-08-18\nISBN-10 / ASIN:   0387906681\nISBN-13 / EAN:   9780387906683\nThis book grew from courses and seminars taught at IMPA and several other \ninstitutions both in Brazil and abroad, a first text being prepared for the \nXth Brazilian Mathematical Colloquium. With several additions, it later \nbecame a book in the Brazilian mathematical collection Projeto Euclides, \npublished in Portuguese. A number of improvements were again made for \nthe present translation. \nWe are most grateful to many colleagues and students who provided us \nwith useful suggestions and, above all, encouragement for us to present these \nintroductory ideas on Geometric Dynamics. We are particularly thankful \nto Paulo Sad and, especially to Alcides Lins Neto, for writing part of a first \nset of notes, and to Anthony Manning for the translation into English. \n\n\nContents\nList of Symbols\nChapter 1 Differentiable Manifolds and Vector Fields 1\n 1 Calculus in 6d&quot; and Differentiable Manifolds 1\n 2 Vector Fields on Manifolds 10\n 3 The Topology of the Space of C'^\\infty Maps 19\n 4 Transversality 23\n 5 Structural Stability 26\nChapter 2 Local Stability 39\n 1 The Tubular Flow Theorem 39\n 2 Linear Vector Fields 41\n 3 Singularities and Hyperbolic Fixed Points 54\n 4 Local Stability 59\n 5 Local Classification 68\n 6 Invariant Manifolds - 73\n 7 The A-lemma (inclination Lemma).
