Rather than offend the common sense of a even fool like GR and QM does by evoking Ã¢â‚¬Å“virtual photonsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and quantum insane hypothetical concept-reifications, the model and explanations must be:\nA: necessitated\nB: provable\nD: explicitly demonstrable\nE: undeniably simplex and self-consistent on all levels.\n\n\nThere are many great non-fiction books on many subjects, however all of them could be removed of superfluous nonsense and reduced by at least 80%, such was the premise for this article; time in life in short, and reading ten pages to find one morsel of truth and helpful insight, I have always found infuriating. Nothing is more hubristic than taking 100 pages to say something that can easily be said in 10. I state outright that for the very first time in history, I will lucidly, rationally, logically, with reason and evidence present you with the genuine model of magnetism, what it is, then what it really is (rather is not in principle but in attribute), how it moves, how it operates, with geometry, angles, charge, and unique specificity with parallel clarity.\nAdditionally regarding magnetism, I will supply you with numerous diagrams showing orientation, movements, pressures, specific angles, and countless first-time revelations about magnetism that will paint a lucid coherent picture, like a laser, burning thru accretions of ignorance about magnetism, to what magnetism really is, its relationship to the other 3 forces, what induces what, what terminates into what and as what. Lastly, and uniquely, I will present you with the correct nature of light, never before fully understood, formerly only half-grasped, and finally a chart showing force unification of gravity, magnetism, dielectricity, and electricity that is so simple, so logical, so undeniable, that even a 15 year old can grasp it; within which is included the equation (G.U.T.) behind all force unification.\nIn writing this very condensed article on magnetism after downloading and owning every book ever written on magnetism, every video ever made on magnetism, and growing up to know this whole time that something is completely askew about magnetism, namely instantaneous action at a distance, how magnetism operates in a total vacuum and thru things upon other ferrous objects, I made an Ã¢â‚¬Å“all or nothingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ desire to understand magnetism, how it works, what it works, what it really is. Rational physics (in one sense) was the only logical approach to understanding magnetism, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“virtual photonsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ explanation of quantum mysticism is no more rational than evoking angels or saying Atlas is holding up the world from below. These demons of mental midgetry have invaded science like a plague; GR and QM have, as Tesla stated, made a mockery of genuine science and clear thinking.\nI have attempted to keep this article extremely lucid however I placed no work into doing same, since it naturally fell that way without any assistance from my own, which of course is always an extremely good sign, anytime something has to be twisted to make it lucid, it likely wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t logical or correct to begin with. I must confess to a secret in the creation of this article, apart from owning every book, article and video ever made on magnetism, nearly 100% of which are utterly nonsensical and self-contradictory trash, I used an ancient methodology with which I made myself intrinsically familiar with well over a decade ago, the same method used by Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus and others; a missing lost rarified art which made PlatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and Socrates works so extremely logical, lucid and self consistent. That method is retroduction, not deduction or induction, but the ancient lost art of retroduction. Using all my experiments and many more into magnetism, I placed all this knowledge thru the Platonic prism of retroduction to draw forth the missing secrets of magnetism, and instead of getting a gush of knowledge, I got a rapidly unfolding dam break as it were of insights into things both deep and so obvious that it erased a lifetime of bad programming and information I was fed (along with everyone else) on magnetism. Literally Ã¢â‚¬Å“working backwardsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, retroduction is a lost ancient method of discovery so acutely helpful its amazing this art is lost completely to modernity, especially that it is so quick in its workings. While deduction and induction sift thru the hay stack for the needle, retroduction works backwards from what is known to the answer, for example knowing that a needle is metal and hay is flammable, set fire to the stack and in an instant all is gone completely leaving the needle glaringly obvious. Kudos again to this lost art of unfolding knowledge!\nYour TV, cellphone, car, computer, hard drives, absolutely everything you touch or use every day is run off either a permanent magnet or magnetic fields or powered by them at their source; however there is not one person on this earth that knows what a field is, what magnetism is, what instant action at a distance is and what mediates it (since it is by particles). We use, replicate, make, and utilized magnets on every corner of the earth and yet all that is present are descriptions of the nature of magnetic uses, but not a single logical or rational explanation of what magnetism actually is. The world is long in descriptions, for which even a child can accomplish. True genius arrives where explanations begin and descriptions end. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœhowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the Ã¢â‚¬ËœwhyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ have eluded humanity on magnetism for far too long. Most amazingly to myself and not to the other lemmings of the world is that magnets are found in every device we use, our cars, phones, televisions, hard drives, headphones, the list in utterly stunning and without end but we are either free not to care or too busy to bother to understand. We, as peoples reproduce magnets and use then in enormous quantities but have no idea what they are. Typical of humans, we learn how to use and reproduce something helpful we stumble across thru the ages, but could care less how it works, and what it really is.\nFrom childhood to adulthood, magnets have fascinated man. Young children are given sets of magnets to play with, linking them end-to-end. School children are shown, with iron ore dust, just how those invisible magnetic lines reach and curl, preparatory to a lecture about the Earth's magnetic field and on to how to use the compass when lost in the woods. The use of magnets so permeates industrialized human society that one would be hard pressed to find an aspect not affected. Lock-free doors secure with magnets, and recyclers separate out metal with magnets, to name but a few. Yet man does not understand magnetism, though theories abound. It's clear that something flows, but just what is flowing is (was) unknown. It's clear that direction is important, but just what is dictating this direction is unclear. It's clear that magnetism occurs naturally, especially in certain ores such as loadstone iron, but what it is that is special about iron ore is a puzzle.\nPeople today ignorantly assume and think you need a multi-million dollar lab to make groundbreaking discoveries. These same fools should be reminded that Tesla, who invented much of the modern world we live in, did not have a Radio Shack or electronics store to go get parts from. Tesla was working with raw steel, copper, wood and wire. He used his keen mind and deductive mental prowess and great reference materials such as Roger Joseph BoscovichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Theory of Natural PhilosophyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The same holds true for Faraday, Steinmetz and Edison. Sharp minds with razor-like deductive capacities solve great mysteries. We still today use the works of Newton who had only his brain, pen, paper and his writings from same. NASA uses these same scribblings to correct for gravity in guiding a satellite to land by remote control on Mars. Great discoveries come from greater minds, not from a particle collider costing many billions of dollars. Humanity may some day learn this lesson.
