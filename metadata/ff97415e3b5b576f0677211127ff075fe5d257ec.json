The plot tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, an adolescent\nninja who constantly searches for recognition and aspires to become a Hokage, the ninja in\nhis village that is acknowledged as the leader and the strongest of all. The series is based\non a one-shot comic by Kishimoto that was published in the August 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump.\n\n==============================================================================\n\nSynopsis:\n----------\nThe opening scene of the movie shows a prediction of what should happen in the future of the movie.\nIt shows Naruto battling a monster, only to be impaled by its tail, killing him and the Nine Tailed Fox\ninside of him. A funeral is held for Naruto in his home village, to which Sakura Haruno, Rock Lee and\nNeji Hyuga are shown to attend, along with others. Finally, the scene shows Tsunade looking out her window,\nasking if 'Everything is just decided by fate'. The setting then returns to a few days previous,\nwhere a man named Yomi attacks a shrine to retrieve the spirit of MÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½, a demon who attempted to take over\nthe world and create his &quot;Thousand Year Kingdom&quot;. Since he is lacking a body, Yomi offers his as a temporary\nsubstitute until they can retrieve MÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½'s original one.\n\nThe only threat to MÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½'s plan is a priestess named Shion, who has the ability to seal his spirit away once more.\nHe raises a stone army from their slumber to attack the rest of the world while his four subordinates go to eliminate Shion.\nThey are given special chakra creatures to enhance their strength.\n\nTo deal with the threat, Konohagakure sends out many advance teams to stall the stone army. Naruto, Sakura, Lee and Neji are\nsent to guard Shion and deliver her to the shrine where MÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½'s body is kept. They fend off Shion's four would-be assassins,\nand, afterwards, Shion prophesies Naruto's upcoming death. Shion's total acceptance of &quot;fate&quot;, as well as her selfish attitude,\nprovokes Naruto into antagonizing her. As they head for the shrine, they are again ambushed by the assassins and, ultimately,\nShion is killed.\n\nThis turns out to be a ruse: the dead &quot;Shion&quot; is actually her servant, Taruho, acting as a decoy,\nvia Shadow Mirror Body Transfer Jutsu. After Neji orders Naruto to escort Shion to the temple alone,\nShion explains that her predictions work by using others' lives to protect her own. Naruto insists that he will not die,\nand likewise will keep Shion safe.\n\nWith teamwork, Sakura, Lee and Neji defeat the assassins, and at the mountain temple where MÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½'s body is kept,\nNaruto and Shion find the stone army waiting. Naruto holds the army back while Shion heads inside to begin the sealing ritual.\nYomi is already inside, and tricks Shion into beginning the technique with him inside the barrier,\nallowing MÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½'s spirit to reunite with his body. With the stone army being destroyed by Kakashi, Shikamaru, Guy and Temari,\nNaruto comes to rescue her. About to see her prediction of his death (the opening scene) come true,\nShion uses her power to change Naruto's fate. She is able to tap into her true powers, intending to kill herself and MÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ to\nsave Naruto (with whom, she has developed feelings for). Naruto stops her seconds before her death,\nand creates a gigantic Rasengan(ChÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ Chakra Rasengan [literally: Super Chakra Spiraling Sphere]) by combining Shion's chakra with his.\nNaruto drives the Rasengan into MÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ and obliterates it.\n\nSpoken Language:- English\n\n==============================================================================\n\nCast\n--------\nSeries cast summary:\nBen Diskin ...
