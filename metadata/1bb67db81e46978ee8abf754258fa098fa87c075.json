Michael Kiske of Helloween has a guest appearance. On this EP, the band has moved away from the sound they had developed on their previous album Hellfire Club. The songs on &quot;Superheroes&quot; are much less akin to the band's native style of power metal, but tends towards the direction of hard rock.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Superheroes&quot;   \t      3:19\n2. \t&quot;Spooks in The Attic&quot;         4:03\n3. \t&quot;Blessing in Disguise&quot;        4:17\n4. \t&quot;Judas at the Opera&quot;  \t      7:21 (feat.
