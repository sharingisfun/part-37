Those are their real names, but as they struggle to blend into a new life in Bridgewater, Iowa, they are all using secret identities. This family is on the run, hiding from the legal system that unjustly convicted Paul Rader of a terrible and violent crime. Adding to the danger, the real killer is now threatening the lives of the Rader children. As Paul works to protect his loved ones and uncover the evidence that will clear him, he lives with the daily fear that someone will accidentally reveal the family's dark secret.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:118825520661ea820a67c7bc0c04eec85c2e21ea","amp;dn":"Runaway+The+Complete+Series-AR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"118825520661ea820a67c7bc0c04eec85c2e21ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,136,37,82,6,97,234,130,10,103,199,188,12,4,238,200,92,46,33,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
