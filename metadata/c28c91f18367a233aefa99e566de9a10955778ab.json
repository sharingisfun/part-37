She has a great career and the JFK-like husband of New York City. But when he proposes to her, she doesn't forget about her family back down South - and, more importantly, her husband back there, who refuses to divorce her ever since she sent divorce paper for almost 5 years. To settle matters straight, she decides to go to the south quick and make him sign the papers. But when things don't turn out the way she planned them out, she realizes that what she had before in the south was far more perfect than the life she had in new york city.
