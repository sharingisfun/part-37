The album reached number six on The Billboard 200 charts in 1993.\n\nThe album contains hits from between &quot;Cuts Like a Knife&quot; (1983) and Waking Up the Neighbours (1991), and a new single, &quot;Please Forgive Me&quot;. The only song on the album that has never been released as a single is &quot;Kids Wanna Rock&quot; from Reckless (1984).\n\nOriginally the song &quot;So Far So Good&quot; was going to be included on the album so the album started and finished with a new song but it was dropped. The song was included on disc two of Anthology.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Summer of '69&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Straight from the Heart&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;It's Only Love&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Can't Stop This Thing We Started&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Do I Have to Say the Words?&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;This Time&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Run to You&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Heaven&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Cuts Like a Knife&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Somebody&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Kids Wanna Rock&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Heat of the Night&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Please Forgive Me&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a435180c5248466de29be2cfde9e8533c4a361fc","amp;dn":"Bryan+Adams+-+So+Far+So+Good+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a435180c5248466de29be2cfde9e8533c4a361fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,53,24,12,82,72,70,109,226,155,226,207,222,158,133,51,196,163,97,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
