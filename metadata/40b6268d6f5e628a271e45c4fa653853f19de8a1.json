With nary a penny in the bank, he charms European stage star Anna Held (Luise Rainer) to headline his &quot;Follies&quot;, and later marries the luscious Ms. Held. From 1907 onward, Ziegfeld stages annual editions of Broadway's most fabulous revue, dedicated to &quot;Glorifying the American Girl&quot; but also giving ample time to develop the comic talents of Fanny Brice (played by herself), Will Rogers, Eddie Cantor and many others. Eventually, Ziegfeld abandons Ms. Held in favor of other beauties, setting the stage for the &quot;telephone scene&quot; which won Luise Rainer the first of her Oscars.\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : The Great Ziegfeld.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 1 703 Kbps\nLength            : 2.21 GiB for 3h 5mn 31s 579ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 480 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027698&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027698&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese (vobsub, muxed in mkv)\n\nMy rip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b6268d6f5e628a271e45c4fa653853f19de8a1","amp;dn":"The+Great+Ziegfeld+%281936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b6268d6f5e628a271e45c4fa653853f19de8a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,182,38,141,111,94,98,138,39,30,69,196,250,101,56,83,241,157,232,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
