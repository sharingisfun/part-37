Bose (Springer, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-387-34524-6\r\n\r\nResearch interest in inorganic membrane materials and processes has significantly increased in recent years due to novel, potentially low-cost energy and fuel production applications. This book documents the recent progress in membrane science, especially in advanced materials and novel reaction and separation concepts. The book classifies membranes based on the mechanism of operation, i.e., size exclusion filtration, solution-diffusion, and mixed ion-electron conduction of the permeate streams","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6838d50addcd4cec5549a6f7e4f9414db67760e1","amp;dn":"Inorganic+Membranes+for+Energy+and+Environmental+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6838d50addcd4cec5549a6f7e4f9414db67760e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,56,213,10,221,205,76,236,85,73,166,247,228,249,65,77,182,119,96,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
