Complicating matters is Coal Miner, who has decided to take a vacation week... but he has nowhere to go, so he hangs around The Shed in his customized &quot;vacation chair.&quot; Meanwhile, Mama Shed and Brooke organize a safety week at The Shed. Even Big Hoss and the Shed Pimps get in on the act, and they all get educated in CPR, mouth-to-mouth and a firefighter demonstration, where Brad loses a battle with a fire hose.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 26-Aug-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:188a1781bef541b9407861c588a578dbf5e0a3ac","amp;dn":"The.Shed.S01E05.HDTV.x264-OMiCRON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"188a1781bef541b9407861c588a578dbf5e0a3ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,138,23,129,190,245,65,185,64,120,97,197,136,165,120,219,245,224,163,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
