The group started as a San Francisco Bay Area nightclub act with an original lineup of Dave Guard, Bob Shane, and Nick Reynolds. It rose to international popularity, fueled by unprecedented sales of 33ÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ ÃƒÂ´ rpm long-playing record albums (LPs), and helped to alter the direction of popular music in the U.S.\n\nThe Kingston Trio was one of the most prominent bands of the era's pop-folk boom that started in 1958 with the release of their first album and its hit recording of &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;, which sold over three million copies as a single. The Trio released nineteen albums that made Billboard's Top 100, fourteen of which ranked in the top 10, and five of which hit the number 1 spot. Four of the group's LPs charted among the Top 10 selling albums for five weeks in November and December 1959, a record unmatched for more than 50 years,[4] and the group still ranks after half a century in the all-time lists of many of Billboard's cumulative charts, including those for most weeks with a number 1 album, most total weeks charting an album, most number 1 albums, most consecutive number 1 albums, and most top ten albums.\n\nMusic historian Richie Unterberger characterized their impact as &quot;phenomenal popularity&quot;, and the Kingston Trio's massive record sales in its early days made acoustic folk music commercially viable, paving the way for singer-songwriter, folk rock, and Americana artists who followed in their wake.\n\n01 - Tom Dooley\n02 - Hard, Ain't It Hard\n03 - 500 Miles\n04 - A Worried Man\n05 - Across the Wide Missouri\n06 - Greenback Dollar\n07 - Coplas\n08 - They Call the Wind Maria\n09 - Scotch and Soda\n10 - Bay of Mexico\n11 - Where Have All the Flowers Gone\n12 - The Tijuana Jail\n13 - The Wreck of the John B\n14 - Scarlet Ribbons\n15 - Blowin' in the Wind\n16 - All My Sorrows\n17 - M.T.A.\n18 - South Coast\n19 - Saro Jane\n20 - Hangman\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87b446fbef2c41fbf16882f171c95f8a285dbeb3","amp;dn":"The+Kingston+Trio+-+Early+American+Heroes+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87b446fbef2c41fbf16882f171c95f8a285dbeb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,180,70,251,239,44,65,251,241,104,130,241,113,201,95,138,40,93,190,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
