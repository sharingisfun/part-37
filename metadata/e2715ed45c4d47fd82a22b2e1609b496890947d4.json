O'Connor, a young reporter with the Las Piernas News Express, is desperate to discover who has perpetrated a savage attack on his mentor, Jack Corrigan. In and out of consciousness, Corrigan claims to have witnessed the burial of a bloodstained car on a farm, but his reputation as a heavy drinker calls his strange story into question. In a seemingly unrelated mystery, five members of the wealthy Ducane family disappear on that same night, including Max Ducane, an infant who would be the heir to two family fortunes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2715ed45c4d47fd82a22b2e1609b496890947d4","amp;dn":"Jan+Burke-Bloodlines+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2715ed45c4d47fd82a22b2e1609b496890947d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,113,94,212,92,77,71,253,130,162,43,46,22,9,180,150,137,9,71,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
