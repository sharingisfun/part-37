The content mainly includes (i) fundamentals for conducting investigations of micro boiling, (ii) microscale boiling and transport phenomena, (iii) boiling characteristics at microscale, (iv) some important applications of micro boiling transport phenomena. This book is intended for researchers and engineers in the field of micro energy systems, electronic cooling, and thermal management in various compact devices/systems at high heat removal and/or heat dissipation. Dr. Xiaofeng Peng, who had passed away on Sep. 10, 2009, was a professor at the Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University, China.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df77d8b738ca16c656946bf1ec087ea02d26adcb","amp;dn":"Micro+Transport+Phenomena+During+Boiling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df77d8b738ca16c656946bf1ec087ea02d26adcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,119,216,183,56,202,22,198,86,148,107,241,236,8,126,160,45,38,173,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
