Hot Chocolate scored an amazing 26\nTop 40 hits over 20 years of chart stardom, with fabulous songs such as It Started With A\nKiss, So You Win Again and Emma. You Sexy Thing was their biggest and most enduring hit,\nmaking the Top Ten in three decades ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the final time after it was used as the signature tune\nto the smash hit film The Full Monty.\n\nYour free CD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hot ChocolateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hottest Hits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is packed with the very best of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\noriginal hits and is a fitting tribute to Errol as he heads towards retirement\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Errol, now 60, has revealed why he\ndecided to take the final curtain. He said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“After my last tour of the UK in 2005, I told my close\nfriends and family that it would be my final time on the road. I intended to just quietly drift\naway from the public eye.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I love going out and performing live but the travelling takes a heavy toll. At my age, I thought\nit was time to kick back and take it easy.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Then, at the beginning of 2008, I started to think that I should do a farewell tour. But IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not\ndoing this for money.\n\n'IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m financially secure because IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve not lived particularly extravagantly or made silly business\ninvestments.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m making this last outing for the fans. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only right that I say a last farewell to them. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to\nsay thank you to all the wonderful people who have been with me since the days of Hot\nChocolate.\n\n'I owe so much to them that disappearing without saying a proper goodbye would not be a\nfitting way to reward their loyalty.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nThat loyalty has spanned nearly four decades, ever since the original five-man group had\ntheir first hit with Love Is Life in 1970.\n\nErrolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shaved head and distinctive soulful vocals gave them a unique look and sound. He\nwrote most of the songs and in 1975 You Sexy Thing turned them into international stars and\nmade him a millionaire.\n\n\n\n1. (03:47) - You Sexy Thing\n2. (04:04) - It Started With A Kiss\n3.
