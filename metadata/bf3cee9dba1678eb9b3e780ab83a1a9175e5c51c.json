A year and half after the Twin Towers fell in New York City, the author found himself in Bagram, Afghanistan working for KBRÃ¢â‚¬â€the notorious Halliburton defense contractor. Over the next decade, he traveled across Afghanistan as part of the U.S.-led military campaign Ã¢â‚¬Å“Operation Enduring Freedom.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ During that time, he worked himself up from an accounting clerk to a senior mentor for Afghan colonels and generals in the western region of Afghanistan. Shona ba Shona (side-by-side) with the Afghan police and the Coalition military forces, Dave Kaelin and the men and women he worked with strove to build the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) into a professional military command capable of defending and protecting the nation and the people of Afghanistan. Along the way, Dave navigates through challenging cultural minefields, sells the U.S. Army on its own programs, and finds maniacal cures for the boredom of a war zone as the military decides how to proceed with the Afghanistan drawdown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf3cee9dba1678eb9b3e780ab83a1a9175e5c51c","amp;dn":"No+Regrets+-+Dave+Kaelin.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf3cee9dba1678eb9b3e780ab83a1a9175e5c51c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,60,238,157,186,22,120,235,155,62,120,10,184,58,26,145,117,229,197,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
