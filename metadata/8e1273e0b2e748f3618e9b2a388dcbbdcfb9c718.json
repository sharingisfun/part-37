No wonder it was good![/quote]\n-\n\nBy Hiram Gomez Pardo HALL OF FAME\n[quote]John Klemmer was one of the most pyramidal exponents of the Smooth Jazz in the eighties. Reading his smart considerations included in the program, it' s easy to understand we are in front of a convinced and integral artist, filled of inspiration and good vibrations.\n\nThis CD is the final result of a rigorous selection along his fruitful career. Some of the best inspired works are Touch, sleeping eyes, Purity, Poem Painter and Barefoot ballet, but in general there is not any weak theme.\n\nSo under this perspective, to acquire this CD would be a wise choice.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e1273e0b2e748f3618e9b2a388dcbbdcfb9c718","amp;dn":"Mosaic+-+The+Best+of+John+Klemmer-Vol+1+Jazz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e1273e0b2e748f3618e9b2a388dcbbdcfb9c718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,18,115,224,178,231,72,243,97,142,155,42,56,141,203,189,207,185,199,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
