During the winter, some songs are written, and afterwards recorded. At this point this two man orchestra is forced to grow. They need someone to vocalize their words scribbled down in distress. Luckily, a suitable interpreter is close to be found. In autumn 2001 this trio shuts off in a bunker deep underground, to give birth to the first ShamRain - release.\n\nAutumn 2005 Shamrain records demos of new songs, that together with unused songs from the &amp;#039;Someplace Else&amp;#039; - sessions are to form the next SR - release, &amp;#039;Deeper into the night&amp;#039; - MCD. During the winter ShamRain records the MCD and finally plays it&amp;#039;s first gigs. Deeper into the night is released April 2006 revealing ShamRain more uptempo than ever, whilst maintaining the quiet and slow moments that make their sound unique. &amp;#039;Deeper into the night&amp;#039; hits Finnish single charts at position 7.\n\n\n\n\nTRACK LISTING\n\nQUOTE\n1.
