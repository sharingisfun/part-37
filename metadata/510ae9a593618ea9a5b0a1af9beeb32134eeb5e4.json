Skype uses P2P (peer-to-peer) technology to connect you to other users Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to share files this time, but to talk and chat with your friends. The technology is extremely advanced Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but super simple to useÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be making free phone calls to your friends in no time! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also an instant messenger as well, because has integrated chat. Skype is the simplest way to save money on your phone bill. Skype does more than phone calls. It also lets you video chat and text chat as well, and send SMS messages. The newest version of Skype also features nifty integration with Firefox Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you can call any phone number you see on a Web site with one click. Skype will automatically recognize your headset, microphone, and speakers, so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to worry about configuration.\n\nTo call another Skype user, enter a user name, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready to go. You can also save a list of users, so calling them back is simple. To call landlines and cell phones, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to set up an account and buy credit. Then, whenever you make a call, that credit is used. Calling other people on Skype is free so you can talk whenever you want to Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not just on special occasions. Call to check in with mum when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re travelling, give your partner a goodnight kiss via video call when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re away on business, or use it for your regular calls and catch ups. And, if you know people who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use Skype you can call them too at really low rates.\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:510ae9a593618ea9a5b0a1af9beeb32134eeb5e4","amp;dn":"Skype+5.11.0.102+Beta%2BFinal%2BPortable%5BWindows%5Dbobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"510ae9a593618ea9a5b0a1af9beeb32134eeb5e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,10,233,165,147,97,142,169,165,176,161,175,155,238,179,33,52,238,181,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
