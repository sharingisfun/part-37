He actually put out three - that&amp;#039;s right, THREE - albums in 2005, I believe this one was the last.  It&amp;#039;s actually pretty gross how prolific he is.  My songs usually gestate for a very long time before bubbling to the surface.\n\nOfficial artist site: http://www.ryan-adams.com\n\nHope you love him as much as I do!  Well, I love his music...we haven&amp;#039;t actually met yet, but I&amp;#039;ll let you know if things change.  Oh, and I also have a video of &quot;Touch, Feel and Lose&quot; as a favorite on YouTube, so if you hunt for my username there, you should find it no problem!\n\nPeace,\n\nJ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1cbbeffe3c2c945c17ea006c006555b2f819ea7","amp;dn":"Ryan+Adams+-+29+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1cbbeffe3c2c945c17ea006c006555b2f819ea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,203,190,255,227,194,201,69,193,126,160,6,192,6,85,91,47,129,158,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
