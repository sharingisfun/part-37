They dig in the heart of   \n    the historic town, in search of the remains of King       \n    Charles II's racing stables - arguably the world's         \n    first stables dedicated for racing.                       \n                                                             \n    It's the last chance to work here, as construction is     \n    about to begin on a multi-million-pound National           \n    Horseracing Museum.                                       \n                                                             \n    From the start of the dig, the challenge for the Team     \n    is to find evidence that will enable them to               \n    distinguish a racing stable from an 'ordinary' royal      \n    stable block. The pressure's on for team leader Jackie   \n    McKinley to deliver the key small find or insight. With   \n    a thick layer of concrete lying over the site, it's not    \n    an easy task.                                             \n                                                             \n    And across the road from the stables site, there's a      \n    second area to explore: King Charles II's 17th-century     \n    Newmarket palace. To add to the excitement, there's the   \n    prospect of Tony Robinson attempting to ride a           \n    mechanical racehorse, and a team visit to the             \n    racecourse on Ladies Day.                                  \n                                                              \n                                                                \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n     ch4 web page currently lists this as ep 5, however the    \n     actual information on that page lists it as ep 4,usual   \n     channel 4 balls up.                                     \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3251e7806c073d3c0904ec11ffdd981ff194d5e1","amp;dn":"Time.Team.S19E04.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3251e7806c073d3c0904ec11ffdd981ff194d5e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,81,231,128,108,7,61,60,9,4,236,17,255,221,152,31,241,148,213,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
