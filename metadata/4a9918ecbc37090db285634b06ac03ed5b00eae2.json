As far as he is concerned, things are pretty good just as they are. He has a wonderful son, whom he is grooming for a place in the civil service, and a weekend hideaway which he loves fixing up. His wife Amalia (Shelly Winters) is also a happy sort, and she adores their son. However, when the boy, an innocent bystander, is killed by some bank robbers, Giovanni&amp;#039;s fuse is finally lit. Soon he is consumed by the need to get revenge.\n\n\nXVID 720 x 384 @1600KBPS\nAC3 192KBPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a9918ecbc37090db285634b06ac03ed5b00eae2","amp;dn":"Mario+Monicelli+-++Un+Borghese+Piccolo+Piccolo+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a9918ecbc37090db285634b06ac03ed5b00eae2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,153,24,236,188,55,9,13,178,133,99,75,6,172,3,237,91,0,234,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
