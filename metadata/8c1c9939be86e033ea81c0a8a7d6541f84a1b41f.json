The performance itself is truly remarkable being recorded only a few weeks into the tour for the debut album and shows a band giving their absolute all.  Brad Delp is at his peak, Scholz and Goudreau trade leads frequently and the fireworks they create are spectacular.  Bass player Sheehan and drummer Hashian, hold down the grooves well throughout and contribute serviceable background vocals as well.  Considering Scholz played almost everything on the studio record himself and Delp did lead and background vocals, the parts are covered very well by the live band.\n\nHighlights include a very early version of, &quot;A Man I'll Never Be&quot; and a blistering version of, &quot;Foreplay/Long Time&quot; as well as a few gems that never made it on their studio albums.  All in all, a hell of a show and one that no Boston fan should be without!\n\n\n\n* Please adhere to the note at the top because it really ticks off the Collector/Trader community as they want to know exactly what they are getting and their current standard is CD-R created from FLAC lossless tracks.  I have converted these FLAC tracks to highest quality 224Kbps VBR MP3 to play them on my PC and iPod and will not be trading them.  Subsequently none of the CD release artwork is included but each of the MP3s has album art embedded that iTunes will pick up.\n\n\nComments appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c1c9939be86e033ea81c0a8a7d6541f84a1b41f","amp;dn":"Boston%3A+More+Than+A+Feeling+%28Agora+Ballroom%2C+Cleveland.+27%2F9%2F76%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c1c9939be86e033ea81c0a8a7d6541f84a1b41f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,28,153,57,190,134,224,51,234,129,192,168,167,214,84,31,132,161,180,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
