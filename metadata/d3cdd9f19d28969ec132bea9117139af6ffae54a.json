W. Norton &amp; Company, 302 pages.\n\nIn 1939 the Savage Mountain claimed its first victim. Born into vast wealth yet uneasy with a life of leisure, Dudley Wolfe, of Boston and Rockport, Maine, set out to become the first man to climb K2, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second-highest mountain and, in the opinion of mountaineers, an even more formidable challenge than Mt. Everest. Although close to middle age and inexperienced at high altitude, Wolfe, with the team leader, made it higher than any other members of the expedition, but he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get back down. Suffering from altitude sickness and severe dehydration, he was abandoned at nearly 25,000 feet; it would be another sixty-three years before the author discovered his remains. 16 pages of photographs; 2 maps.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nJennifer Jordan, an award-winning author, filmmaker, and screenwriter, has twice lived at the base of K2, where in 2002 she found the remains of Dudley Wolfe, the hero of The Last Man on the Mountain, her second book. She lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Last-Man-Mountain-American-Adventurer/dp/0393339971&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Last-Man-Mountain-American-Adventurer/dp/0393339971&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3cdd9f19d28969ec132bea9117139af6ffae54a","amp;dn":"Jennifer+Jordan+-+The+Last+Man+on+the+Mountain.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3cdd9f19d28969ec132bea9117139af6ffae54a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,205,217,241,157,40,150,158,193,50,190,169,17,113,57,175,111,250,229,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
