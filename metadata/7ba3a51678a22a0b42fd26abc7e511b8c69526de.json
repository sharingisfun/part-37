Action greats Donnie Yen (SPL) \nand Yu Rong Guang (My Father is a Hero) team up and face off in blistering martial arts set pieces. \nSet in the late 19th-century Canton folklore era of patriotic heroes, evil oppressors, and chest-thumping righteous action, \nIron Monkey revolves around the heroic struggles of a patriotic vigilante, folk hero Wong Kei Ying, \nand his even more famous son Wong Fei Hung, here still an adolescent and played by actress Angie Tsang.\n\nSoft-spoken doctor by day, vigilante Iron Monkey by night, physician Yang (Yu Rong Guang) has the local Qing government up in arms\n with his Robin Hood-like heroic exploits against the town's corrupt overlords. With the authorities randomly dragging people off\n the streets on fabricated suspicions, Wong Kei Ying (Donnie Yen) and his son Fei Hung (Angie Tsang), who just rolled into town, \nare quickly arrested when they display their martial arts prowess. The unscrupulous magistrate holds Fei Hung hostage, \nand orders Wong Kei Ying to capture Iron Monkey in exchange for his son.
