So I decided to make life a bit easier and created this installation package. Hopefully it will attract more people to this mod. Please note that changes to files are minimal (corrected formatting and size changes) and do not change the game play in any way at all.\n\nThe following CoW downloads have beeen included:\n\n    Base install 1.4\n    Patch 1.4.4\n    Music Patch\n    English Language patch\n\nOther downloads from TWCenter:\n\n    German Language\n    French Language\n    Italian Language\n    Spanish Language\n\nWork done:\n\n    Removed all unessary files (duplicates, wrongly placed, not needed)\n    Reduced texture sizes of strat models and buildings (reduces lag)\n    Enlarged radar map\n    Adapted checker for modelDB file and made corrections\n    Added my CoW language installer pack 2.0\n\nComments:\n\n    Reduction in size on disk - 3.05GB\n    Reduction in installer size - 1.54GB\n    The installer has to be in two parts because more then 2GB size is not supported by this program.\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n    Download all parts (5*part1 and 6*part2) into one directory\n    Run the EXE of part1 (DO files will be installed automatically)\n    Run the EXE of part2 (DO files will be installed automatically)\n    Update the language installer\n    Choose your language from the shortcuts on your desktop\n\nImportant:\n\n    Both installers will appear to be frozen at the beginning for a few minutes due to some huge files being installed (animations pack and sound pack respectively).\n    DO NOT cancel the installation unless you get an error message!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:613643096509204bcc84daca74fa694b4433262a","amp;dn":"Call+of+Warhammer+1.4.4+-+Easy+and+painfree+Installation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"613643096509204bcc84daca74fa694b4433262a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,54,67,9,101,9,32,75,204,132,218,202,116,250,105,75,68,51,38,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
