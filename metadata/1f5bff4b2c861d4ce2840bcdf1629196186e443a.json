With this release of LT+ you HAVE to have an original Benq or Liteon.\n\nLT+ for slim 9504 is next followed by LT+ for slim 0225\n\nThanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.\nThanks go to Team Xecuter for their generous support and input to this project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f5bff4b2c861d4ce2840bcdf1629196186e443a","amp;dn":"iXtreme+LT+Plus+Firmware+Pack+XBOX360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f5bff4b2c861d4ce2840bcdf1629196186e443a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,91,255,75,44,134,29,76,226,132,11,205,241,98,145,150,24,110,68,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
