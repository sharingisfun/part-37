Unlike a typical whodunit, Elton does not reveal the identity of the victim until around halfway into the book.\n\nTaken From Amazon\n\nOne house. Ten contestants. Thirty cameras. Forty microphones. Yet again the public gorges its voyeuristic appetite as another group of unknown and unremarkable people submit themselves to the brutal exposure of the televised real-life soap opera, House Arrest. Everybody knows the rules: total strangers are forced to live together while the rest of the country watches them do it. Who will crack first? Who will have sex with whom? Who will the public love and who will they hate? All the usual questions. And then, suddenly, there are some new ones. Who is the murderer? How did he or she manage to kill under the constant gaze of the thirty television cameras? Why did they do it? And who will be next?\n\nMore About The Novel &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Famous_%28novel%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Famous_%28novel%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout The Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Elton&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Elton&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826092f716c084e34a897f658b567554a06284b2","amp;dn":"Audio+Book+%3A+Ben+Elton+-+Dead+Famous","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826092f716c084e34a897f658b567554a06284b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,96,146,247,22,192,132,227,74,137,127,101,139,86,117,84,160,98,132,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
