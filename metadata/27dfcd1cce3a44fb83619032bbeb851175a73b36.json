From pathfinding pilots to scientists, from the officers confronted with Hitler's atrocities at Belsen to the inventors of radar ; they all played a part in hastening the end of the most cataclysmic conflict ever.\n\nWeapons of WW II \nIn 1939, the world went to war using obsolete weaponry. In order to gain supremacy it was necessary for an army of designers, inventors and manufacturers to develop and manufacture more and more sophisticated killing machines. In this series &quot;WEAPONS OF WORLD WAR II&quot; the development of each weapon system is addressed from the outbreak of war through to its peak in 1945.\n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for BBC Worldwide Ltd\n\n\n\nEpisode 17 : The Battleship\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, battleships were seen as the key weapon at sea, their huge firepower dominated the waves but over the next six years their vulnerability was exposed by the submarine and aircraft. This programme looks at the great clashes of the ships such as Bismarck and King George V and the way in which the battleships' role changed to that of shore bombardment and escort work.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 3047 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 23:39.200\nNumber Of Parts: 20\nPart Size: 550 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27dfcd1cce3a44fb83619032bbeb851175a73b36","amp;dn":"BBC.Heroes.and.Weapons.of.WWII.17of20.The.Battleship.XviD.AC3.MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27dfcd1cce3a44fb83619032bbeb851175a73b36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,223,205,28,206,58,68,251,131,97,144,50,187,235,133,17,117,167,59,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
