Despite their nationality and time period, the band is not generally considered krautrock because of their sound, which has much more in common with English symphonic rock groups such as Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes and Camel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eb8c1f523c0c23b4ec5813dfdae70f1f9a9f017","amp;dn":"Eloy+-+Vinyl+collection+1971-1984","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eb8c1f523c0c23b4ec5813dfdae70f1f9a9f017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,184,193,245,35,192,194,59,78,197,129,61,253,174,112,241,249,169,240,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
