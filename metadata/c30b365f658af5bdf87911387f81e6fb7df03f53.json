Duncan might hold the \nkey to all of the girls' answers, but can they \ntrust him to let down their guard? And just when \nthey feel like Duncan may be the only lead, Jason \ndrops off a bag of Alison's personal items that \ncould be more than just a bag of junk.\n\n18/Slower+\nEvolve... or die.\n\nEnjoy :)\nmadcow at hushmail dot com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c30b365f658af5bdf87911387f81e6fb7df03f53","amp;dn":"Pretty.Little.Liars.S02E23.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c30b365f658af5bdf87911387f81e6fb7df03f53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,11,54,95,101,138,245,189,248,121,17,56,127,129,230,251,125,240,63,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
