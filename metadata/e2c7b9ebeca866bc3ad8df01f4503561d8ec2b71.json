It's kind of like Memento in that every section of the movie takes place before the previous section. This is no-budget indie film-making at its finest. \n\nSupport the people that worked hard on this gem and buy the DVD! It's $16 which includes shipping, and mine came with the cover and DVD signed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2c7b9ebeca866bc3ad8df01f4503561d8ec2b71","amp;dn":"Hell+is+Full+%5BDVDRip+2010+original+indie+zombie+movie%5D%5BzombiRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2c7b9ebeca866bc3ad8df01f4503561d8ec2b71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,199,185,235,236,168,102,188,58,216,223,1,244,80,53,97,216,236,43,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
