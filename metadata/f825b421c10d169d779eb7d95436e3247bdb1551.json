This\none was published in 1910. It charts the rise of Denry Machin\n(The Card), who, through luck, guile and cheek escapes his\npoor background to become Mayor of Bursley.\n\nBursley was based on Burslem, now part of the Stoke on\nTrent Connurbation. \n\nI hope that the BBC is planning to do more of Bennett's\nFive Towns' novels.
