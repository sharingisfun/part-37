Formed in 1967 in New York City, NY, Every Mother's Son attempted to Xerox the Monkees' innocuous bubblegum pop. Consisting of brothers Dennis Larden (vocals, guitar) and Larry Larden (guitar, vocals), Schuyler Larsen (bass), Bruce Milner (keyboards), and Christopher Augustine (drums), Every Mother's Son was signed to MGM and released their debut LP in 1967. The catchy &quot;Come on Down to My Boat&quot; was a Top Ten hit in the U.S., but the group wasn't able recapture its success. The band released another album, Every Mother's Son's Back; however, their appeal had already started to dissipate. &quot;Come on Down to My Boat&quot; may have acquired Every Mother's Son a slice of fame, but a career cannot be propelled by one song, and the group folded in 1969. Dennis Larden joined Rick Nelson's Stone Canyon Band. In the late '80s, VH1 dusted off the video for &quot;Come on Down to My Boat&quot; and added it to regular rotation, aiming to attract baby boomers who had a fond recollection for the forgotten classic. The track has since become a fixture on oldies radio stations.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/every-mothers-son-p17371/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/every-mothers-son-p17371/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nCollectables' Come On Down to My Boat contains the entirety of Every Mother's Son's eponymous debut, which included their huge hit &quot;Come On Down to My Boat,&quot; plus three bonus tracks -- &quot;Put Your Mind at Ease,&quot; &quot;Pony With the Golden Mane,&quot; &quot;No One Knows&quot; -- which were all minor hit singles in the years following their lone Top Ten hit. &quot;Come on Down to My Boat&quot; is one of the great one-shots of the '60s, and not surprisingly, there's nothing nearly as memorable on the remainder of the record, but there are some enjoyable pop-rockers in the same vein. It may not contain much from the group's second record, but the fact that it contains all of the group's hits, plus a representative selection of lesser-known material, makes this a fine summation of the group's career.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-every-mothers-son-come-on-down-to-my-boat-r331323&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-every-mothers-son-come-on-down-to-my-boat-r331323&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000945&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000945&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
