Gary Barlow has had one of the most incredible stories in pop history. We follow Gary's near-25-year career, from its beginnings to the Take That phenomenon, the wilderness years as the industry he loves cast him aside, and the darker times which have inspired his lyrics.\n\n thanks to capper and poster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da644da31bc4d0c8f51c3e95f768758150955da0","amp;dn":"When+Corden+Met+Barlow+HDTV+x264-FTP+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da644da31bc4d0c8f51c3e95f768758150955da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,100,77,163,27,196,208,200,245,28,62,149,247,104,117,129,80,149,93,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
