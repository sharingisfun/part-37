Thanks to a realistic physics engine and meticulous unit balance, gameplay is highly varied and flexible. Your success or failure will be dictated by clear planning, an understanding of the terrain and an ability to mobilise your troops effectively; brute force alone will likely get you killed.\n\nSet against the backdrop of an ancient cyclical struggle, Myth II tracks the progress of the forces of light in an epic crusade for survival. The wild lands and immersive history of MythÃ¢â‚¬â€influenced heavily by mythology and literatureÃ¢â‚¬â€provide an exquisite setting for the desperate battle to defeat Soulblighter's dark minions, and secure the fate of the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5cce1475e9856eccf8a9f0a297f298a95117196","amp;dn":"Myth+II%3A+Soulblighter+Version+1.8+%2B+mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5cce1475e9856eccf8a9f0a297f298a95117196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,204,225,71,94,152,86,236,207,138,159,10,41,127,41,138,149,17,113,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
