Convinced \nthat there is no such thing as having too many \nclubs or activities listed on her resume, Lisa \njumps at the opportunity to coach Bart's little \nleague team. Despite having little understanding \nof baseball, Lisa coaches the team to a record \nwinning streak by putting her book smarts in \nstatistics and probability into play. But when \nBart questions Lisa's coaching tactics and \nconfronts her for taking the fun out of \nbaseball, Lisa benches him from the championship \ngame. Hoping to lift his spirits, Marge spends \nthe day with Bart at an amusement park where MLB \nmanager and former catcher Mike Scioscia (guest-\nvoicing as himself) gives Bart sound advice and \nreminds him of his genuine love of the sport. \nMeanwhile, with one last chance to win the game, \nLisa makes an unexpected call and learns that \nthere is more to sports than winning.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdcb8b47650a0514da7d7fa0831a5fed7ec2d9fa","amp;dn":"The.Simpsons.S22E03.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdcb8b47650a0514da7d7fa0831a5fed7ec2d9fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,203,139,71,101,10,5,20,218,125,127,160,131,26,95,237,126,194,217,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
