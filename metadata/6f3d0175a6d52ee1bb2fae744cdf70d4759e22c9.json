Holub, an internationally \ndistinguished scientist, is Czecho-\nslovakia's most lively and experimental \npoet. The scientist in him is always\n creatively present in his poems,\nlurking behind his restless experiments\n in free verse and his constant\n probing below the obvious surface \nof things. Above all he shows an \nunwavering sense of the realities of \nlife.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f3d0175a6d52ee1bb2fae744cdf70d4759e22c9","amp;dn":"%28ebook+-+poetry%29+Miroslav+Holub+-+Selected+Poems.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f3d0175a6d52ee1bb2fae744cdf70d4759e22c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,61,1,117,166,213,46,225,187,47,174,116,76,223,112,212,117,158,34,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
