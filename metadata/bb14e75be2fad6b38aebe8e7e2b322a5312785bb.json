Then the holes appear. The first forms in Central Park, in sight of an apartment where Repairman Jack and a man as old as time watch with growing dread. Gaping holes, bottomless and emptyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until sundown, when the first unearthly, hungry creatures appear.\n \nNightworld brings F. Paul WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Adversary Cycle and Repairman Jack saga to an apocalyptic finale as Jack and Glaeken search the Secret History to gather a ragtag army for a last stand against the Otherness and a hideously transformed Rasalom.\nFrequently Bought Together\n\nepub and mobi.\n\nthis book was released in may 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb14e75be2fad6b38aebe8e7e2b322a5312785bb","amp;dn":"Nightworld++Revised+Edition+%28Repairman+Jack-Adversary+Cycle%29+By+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb14e75be2fad6b38aebe8e7e2b322a5312785bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,20,231,91,226,250,214,179,138,235,232,231,226,179,34,165,49,39,133,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
