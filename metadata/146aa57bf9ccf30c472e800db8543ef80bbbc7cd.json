Ã¢â‚¬Å“This album crosses a lot of borders,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ferrick says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a little bit of the Northeast, a bit of the South, and a bit of Nashville, too.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The album features the talents of Natalia Zukerman on vocals, lap steel and dobro, Matt Pynn (Lucinda Williams, Evan Dando) on pedal steel, Richard Gates (Richard Thompson, Suzanne Vega) on bass, Ro Rowan (Bob Forrest, Tiffany) on cello and both Steve Scully (Howie Day, Juliana Hatfield) and Dave Brophy (Will Daily, Patty Larkin) on drums.
