Steve Hillage as the main composer and lead guitarist, keyboard player Dave Stewart, bassist Nick Greenwood and drummer Eric Peachy did a pleasant and respectable job. Despite the often poor song lyrics and some clumsy Hard Rock splinters, the only released album by Khan is a good and worthy example for the Canterbury music style, far apart from beeing tedious or distressing.\n\nmore infos at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1172&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1172&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3225ec311d64b4a3946c3df78deaa307a9d5cf2","amp;dn":"Khan+%28with+Steve+Hillage%29+-+1972+-+Space+Shanty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3225ec311d64b4a3946c3df78deaa307a9d5cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,34,94,195,17,214,75,74,57,70,195,223,120,222,170,48,122,157,92,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
