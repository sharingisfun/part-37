The single was released in early May 2005 and peaked at #18 in the UK charts (see 2005 in music). Kele Okereke, lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the indie rock band Bloc Party is featured on vocals. The song was featured in the 2005 snowboarding video &quot;Flavor Country&quot; by Sandbox. It also samples the opening of Daft Punk's Face to Face. \n\nThe music video, directed by Dom and Nic, contains scenes filmed at the now defunct MG Rover Longbridge plant now owned by SAIC . It starts out with a man watching women in an exercise video dance on a window TV in a store, possibly spoofing the then-recent video for Eric Prydz's single &quot;Call On Me&quot;. The man turns out to be a paranoid factory worker terrified of the automated assembly robot he operates, possibly under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs or possibly painkillers, as he has a cast on his left arm. He imagines the machines watching and threatening him, seeing them outside the factory, chasing him before disappearing. Finally, even after quitting his job, the man is pursued to the top of the building by one of the arms, where it lunges at him before disappearing. He runs onto the street, and sees multiple machines lumbering toward him, and his view of the world disintegrates into a mess of geometric shapes and colours. He collapses, laughing hysterically as robots disappear once again.\n\nThe Chemical Brothers are a British electronic music duo composed of Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons. Originating in Manchester in 1991, along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, and fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture. In the UK, they have had five number-one albums and 13 top-20 singles, including two number ones.\n\nThe duo have won a number of awards throughout their career, including four Grammy AwardsÃ¢â‚¬â€twice for Best Electronic/Dance Album, and in 2000 won the Brit Award for Best British Dance Act.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Believe_(The_Chemical_Brothers_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Believe_(The_Chemical_Brothers_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jANCKaaEp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jANCKaaEp&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:22\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
