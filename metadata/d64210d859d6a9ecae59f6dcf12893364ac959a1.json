The year we cured cancer. The year we cured the common cold. And the year the dead started to walk. The year of the Rising.\r\n\r\nThe year was 2039. The world didn't end when the zombies came, it just got worse. Georgia and Shaun Mason set out on the biggest story of their generation. They uncovered the biggest conspiracy since the Rising and realized that to tell the truth, sacrifices have to be made.\r\n\r\nNow, the year is 2041, and the investigation that began with the election of President Ryman is much bigger than anyone had assumed. With too much left to do and not much time left to do it in, the surviving staff of After the End Times must face mad scientists, zombie bears, rogue government agencies-and if there's one thing they know is true in post-zombie America, it's this:\r\n\r\nThings can always get worse.\r\n\r\nBlackout is the conclusion to the epic trilogy that began in the Hugo-nominated Feed and the sequel, Deadline. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64210d859d6a9ecae59f6dcf12893364ac959a1","amp;dn":"Mira+Grant+-+Blackout+%28Newsflesh+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64210d859d6a9ecae59f6dcf12893364ac959a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,66,16,216,89,214,169,236,174,89,246,220,241,40,147,54,74,201,89,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
