It is the only program that provides anti-phishing protection and goes beyond password management by adding web form filling and automatic strong password generation. All your confidential information, including passwords, identities, and credit cards, is kept secure in one secure place using a highly encrypted keychain.\n\n1Password fully supports most web browsers, including Safari, OmniWeb, DEVONagent, Firefox, Flock, Fluid, and NetNewsWire. All browser extensions share the data stored in the keychain which means you never need to manually copy your passwords between browsers or from the password manager to a browser ever again!\n\n1Password has received numerous awards, including 4.5 mice from Macworld magazine, MacLife Editors pick, and was the Pick of Week on MacBreak Weekly by both Leo Laporte and Merlin Mann.\n\nWhat's New\n\n* Changed: Modified attachment cleanup code to attempt to solve Mac\n  OS X 10.7 hang on exit.\n\n* Changed: Now using SSL for Install Extensions page and extension\n  download links.
