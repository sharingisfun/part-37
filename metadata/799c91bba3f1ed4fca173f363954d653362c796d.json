After Chance dismisses as a prank an anonymous phone call warning him that there&amp;#039;s a corpse buried in the marsh, Lt. Milo Sturgis, now Special Case Investigator for the LAPD, and Sturgis&amp;#039;s team find four bodies there, all women missing their right hand. When Sturgis identifies one of the victims as Selena Bass, who worked as a piano teacher for the wealthy Vander family, the police focus on Travis Huck, the manager of the Vanders&amp;#039; Pacific Palisades estate, as the prime suspect because Travis has a criminal past. Kellerman fans wanting more of the same should be satisfied, though Sturgis gets less benefit from Delaware&amp;#039;s psychological expertise than usual.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:799c91bba3f1ed4fca173f363954d653362c796d","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Kellerman+-+Bones+-+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"799c91bba3f1ed4fca173f363954d653362c796d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,156,145,187,163,241,237,79,202,23,63,54,57,84,214,83,54,44,121,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
