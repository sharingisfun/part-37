One of the most noticeable changes in 5.7 version is a filtration of https traffic. Now Adguard can block advertisements in e-mail web interfaces, social networks, chats &amp; etc. Implementation of a new network driver made it possible to fix most of the known conflicts with third-party software. \n\nAdguard is a popular Internet filter that blocks ads, pop-ups, phishing &amp; malicious websites. While working silently in the background, it automatically removes advertisements from the web pages you visit, thereby saving your traffic and reducing the page loading time. The program supports both 32x and 64x Windows versions, and it works with all popular browsers. \n\nKey features of Adguard:\n\n1. Saves time and nerves;\n2. Works with all popular browsers;\n3. Easy to use, works just out of the box, needs no tuning or customization;\n4. Comes with a browser module for manual ad blocking;\n5. Updated regularly;\n6. Works on 32x and 64x Windows versions.\n\nChange log is not big. Bug fixes mostly.\n\nWe need this release for two things:\n1. Adguard 5.8 is prepared to be pushed to Windows Marketplace (as a desktop app of course).\n2. Testing improved injection algorithm. We are on the way of adding userscripts feature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfe383077225cbe46e48937cdbff8cef4b656e80","amp;dn":"adguard_5.8_Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfe383077225cbe46e48937cdbff8cef4b656e80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,227,131,7,114,37,203,228,110,72,147,124,219,255,140,239,75,101,110,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
