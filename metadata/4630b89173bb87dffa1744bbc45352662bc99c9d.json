Does drinking coffee really cause cancer? Does bisphenol-A in our tin can linings really cause reproductive damage? Good Science, Bad Science, Pseudoscience, and Just Plain Bunk teaches readers how to think like a scientist to question claims like these more critically.\n\n Peter A. Daempfle introduces readers to the basics of scientific inquiry, defining what science is and how it can be misused. Through provocative real-world examples, the book helps readers acquire the tools needed to distinguish scientific truth from myth. The book celebrates science and its role in society while building scientific literacy.\n\n\n2013 epub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4630b89173bb87dffa1744bbc45352662bc99c9d","amp;dn":"Good+Science%2C+Bad+Science%2C+Pseudoscience%2C+and+Just+Plain+BS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4630b89173bb87dffa1744bbc45352662bc99c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,48,184,145,115,187,135,223,250,23,68,187,196,83,82,102,43,201,156,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
