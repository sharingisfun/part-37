Beautifully shot in Cinemascope by Sacha Vierny, the movie is a riddle of seduction, a mercurial enigma darting between a present and past which may not even exist, let alone converge. The film stars Giorgio Albertazzi as an unnamed sophisticate attempting to convince a similarly nameless woman (Delphine Seyrig) that they met and were romantically involved a year ago in the same enormous, baroque European hotel. In the end, it hardly matters -- they're not characters so much as pawns anyway. Hypnotically dreamlike, Last Year at Marienbad is a surrealist parody of Hollywood melodrama, a high-fashion romance with a dark, alien underbelly. According to screenwriter Alain Robbe-Grillet, the movie is a pure construction, without a frame of reference outside of its own existence -- the lives of its characters begin when the lights go down, and conclude when they come back up.\n\n  General\n      Complete name : Alain Resnais-L'annÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e derniÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Marienbad ('Last Year at Marienbad') (1961).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 2056 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 12.7 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 1474 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 2.35\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.278\n      StreamSize : 999 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 382 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 259 MiB\n   Audio #2\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 190 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 129 MiB\n\nFrench audio, English subpack\n\nIMDB: tt0054632\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by EceAyhan\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e1035a5240a4a9462c6f304b8c585a039abf0f","amp;dn":"Last+Year+at+Marienbad+-+CC+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e1035a5240a4a9462c6f304b8c585a039abf0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,225,3,90,82,64,164,169,70,44,111,48,75,140,88,90,3,154,191,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
