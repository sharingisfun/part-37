The show, which was filmed over the course of five months, followed the lives of three family groups that agreed to live as homesteaders did on the American frontier in 1883. Each family was given a 160 acre plot of land and an allotment of food, supplies, and livestock. They were expected to establish a homestead and complete the tasks necessary to prepare for the harsh Montana winter. At the end of season, before winter struck, each family was judged by a panel of frontier experts and historians, and the likelihood of survival for each group was assessed.\n\nFrontier House followed in the footsteps of the successful The 1900 House, a British series which originally aired on PBS in 2000. Manor House, Colonial House, 1940&amp;#039;s House, and Regency House Party followed the successful series and the latest, Texas Ranch House, aired in May 2006.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec019872233133828ebd49ed71858fa34b911ca","amp;dn":"Frontier+House.2002.PBS.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec019872233133828ebd49ed71858fa34b911ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,192,25,135,34,51,19,56,40,235,212,158,215,24,88,250,52,185,17,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
