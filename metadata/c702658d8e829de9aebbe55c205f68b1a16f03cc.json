All tracks on the collection have been previously released.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c702658d8e829de9aebbe55c205f68b1a16f03cc","amp;dn":"Various+Artist+-+InFine+by+JEAN+MICHEL+JARRE+%282013%29+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c702658d8e829de9aebbe55c205f68b1a16f03cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,2,101,141,142,130,157,233,174,187,229,92,32,95,104,177,161,111,3,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
