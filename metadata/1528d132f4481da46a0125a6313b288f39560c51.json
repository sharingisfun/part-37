Though the game states Buckethead wrote the song \\&quot;Jordan\\&quot; for the game, only the solo was written for the game, and was composed of several different solos. The song itself has been played live for years (It was played on the 2004 tour, and possibly earlier than that, though the earlier recordings were far different and far easier played), prior to even the release of the first Guitar Hero game (Released in 2005). The game merely marks the first studio recording of the song to be released.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1528d132f4481da46a0125a6313b288f39560c51","amp;dn":"Buckethead%2F+Jordan+%28Guitar+Hero+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1528d132f4481da46a0125a6313b288f39560c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,40,209,50,244,72,29,164,106,1,37,166,49,59,40,143,57,86,12,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
