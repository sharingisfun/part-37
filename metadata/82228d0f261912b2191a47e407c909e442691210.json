An evening with Eddie \r\nIzzard in which he moves back and forth in time, with religion \r\nas the loose but constant theme. He begins with Pope John Paul \r\nII, and then criss-crosses to Pius XII, the Spanish Inquisition, \r\nthe Crusades and Jerusalem, the world's five major religions, \r\nthe Dark Ages, Jesus, and the future. Along the way, Izzard makes \r\nobservations about guns and monkeys, the World Series, the NRA and \r\nthe IRA, mad cows, Socrates, the Stoned Olympics, the Roman Empire, \r\nthe Renaissance, and the Mona Lisa. Izzard wears black nylons, \r\nblack leather pants, a black jacket and a diamond necklace.\r\n\r\nNOTE: One of the extras is a stand-up show itself, in French.\r\nDefinitely worth checking out.\r\n\r\nFILE INFO:\r\n\r\nContainer.......: mkv\r\nFile Size.......: 1,11 GB (show)\r\n                  725 MB (extras)\r\nRun Time........: 01:21:34 (show)\r\n                  01:19:12 (extras)\r\nVideo Resolution: 698x540 (1.29:1)\r\nVideo Codec.....: x264\r\nVideo Quality...: Constant RF: 20,0\r\nAudio 1.........: English, aac, 2.0 channels, 160 kbps\r\nAudio 2.........: Eddie's Commentary, aac, 2.0 channels, 160 kbps\r\nSoft-Coded Subs.: English, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, \r\n                  Swedish, Norwegian, French, Finnish, Trivia Track\r\n                  (VobSub, Muxed in)\r\nFramerate.......: 25,00\r\nSource..........: DVD (PAL)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82228d0f261912b2191a47e407c909e442691210","amp;dn":"Eddie.Izzard.Circle.2002.x264.aac.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82228d0f261912b2191a47e407c909e442691210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,34,141,15,38,25,18,178,25,26,71,228,7,201,9,228,66,105,18,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
