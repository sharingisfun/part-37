Remarkably we get a dry and witty George Sanders (Addison DeWitt in All About Eve), a 20-year-old Angela Lansbury (Murder, She Wrote), an equally young Donna Reed (The Donna Reed Show), and fabulous Oscar-winning photography mixing black and white with a little splash of color for effect when they show the painting. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a unique fantasy horror film that could easily slip into your collection next to the moody Universal monster classics, but containing more subtlety and wit to write it off as merely a creature feature. The story revolves around a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. He has a painting made that will age instead of him, and all of his sins will be wrought on the image of his visage in oil. He adopts a libertine immoral code, and loses all compassion and anything truly good about being human. Dorian transforms in to a young dashing beautiful monster.\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\nVideo Formats:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full Frame\nAudio Formats:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono (English)\nSubtitles:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ English\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ French\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Spanish\nRunning Time: 110 Minutes\nRelease Year: 1945","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2d8d46ac56a86c9832c1b65d477c53a6d7cd7fa","amp;dn":"Picture+of+Dorian+Gray+DVDR+untouched","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2d8d46ac56a86c9832c1b65d477c53a6d7cd7fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,216,212,106,197,106,134,201,131,44,27,101,212,119,197,58,109,124,215,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
