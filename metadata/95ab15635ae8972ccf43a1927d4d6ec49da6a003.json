Wehrspohn et al. (Wiley-VCH, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-527-41175-7\r\n\r\nWritten by renowned experts in the field of photon management in solar cells, this one-stop reference gives an introduction to the physics of light management in solar cells, and discusses the different concepts and methods of applying photon management.\r\nThe authors cover the physics, principles, concepts, technologies, and methods used, explaining how to increase the efficiency of solar cells by splitting or modifying the solar spectrum before they absorb the sunlight. In so doing, they present novel concepts and materials allowing for the cheaper, more flexible manufacture of solar cells and systems.\r\nFor educational purposes, the authors have split the reasons for photon management into spatial and spectral light management.\r\nBridging the gap between the photonics and the photovoltaics communities, this is an invaluable reference for materials scientists, physicists in industry, experimental physicists, lecturers in physics, Ph.D. students in physics and material sciences, engineers in power technology, applied and surface physicists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95ab15635ae8972ccf43a1927d4d6ec49da6a003","amp;dn":"Photon+Management+in+Solar+Cells","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95ab15635ae8972ccf43a1927d4d6ec49da6a003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,171,21,99,90,232,151,44,207,67,161,146,125,77,110,196,157,166,160,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
