(AP, 2002).pdf\r\n\r\nPrinciples of Cloning is the first comprehensive book on animal cloning since the creation of Dolly. The contributing authors are the principal investigators on each of the animal species cloned to date, and are expertly qualified to present the state-of-the-art information in their respective areas. Editors Cibelli, Lanza and West garnered worldwide spotlight late in 2001 when their company, Advanced Cell Technology, announced the successful engineering of the world's first cloned human embryo. The trio was featured in the US News &amp; World Report December 2001 cover story, &quot;The First Human Clone.&quot; The book presents the basic biological mechanisms of how cloning works and progresses to discuss current and potential applications in basic biology, agriculture, biotechnology, and medicine.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n* First and most comprehensive book on animal cloning\r\n* Chapters written by the world' expert in each area\r\n* From the early experiments in amphibia to the latest one in mammals, everything is included in this book and told by the researcher that did it and how they did it\r\n* Basic biological mechanisms on how cloning works and all their current and potential applications\r\n* Cloning applications on basic biology, agriculture, biotechnology and medicine are included\r\n* Editors are the pioneers in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8985945a36d2f42d6baf90694953d3494d315187","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Cloning+-+Jose+Cibelli+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8985945a36d2f42d6baf90694953d3494d315187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,133,148,90,54,210,244,45,107,175,144,105,73,83,211,73,77,49,81,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
