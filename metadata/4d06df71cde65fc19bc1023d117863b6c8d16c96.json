Gary J. Bass shows how Nixon and Kissinger supported PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military dictatorship as it brutally quashed the results of a historic free election. The Pakistani army launched a crackdown on what was then East Pakistan (today an independent Bangladesh), killing hundreds of thousands of people and sending ten million refugees fleeing to IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the worst humanitarian crises of the twentieth century.\n\nNixon and Kissinger, unswayed by detailed warnings of genocide from American diplomats witnessing the bloodshed, stood behind PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military rulers. Driven not just by Cold War realpolitik but by a bitter personal dislike of India and its leader Indira Gandhi, Nixon and Kissinger actively helped the Pakistani government even as it careened toward a devastating war against India. They silenced American officials who dared to speak up, secretly encouraged China to mass troops on the Indian border, and illegally supplied weapons to the Pakistani militaryÃ¢â‚¬â€an overlooked scandal that presages Watergate.\n\nDrawing on previously unheard White House tapes, recently declassified documents, and extensive interviews with White House staffers and Indian military leaders, The Blood Telegram tells this thrilling, shadowy story in full. Bringing us into the drama of a crisis exploding into war, Bass follows reporters, consuls, and guerrilla warriors on the groundÃ¢â‚¬â€from the desperate refugee camps to the most secretive conversations in the Oval Office. \n\nBass makes clear how the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ embrace of the military dictatorship in Islamabad would mold AsiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s destiny for decades, and confronts for the first time Nixon and KissingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden role in a tragedy that was far bloodier than Bosnia. This is a revelatory, compulsively readable work of politics, personalities, military confrontation, and Cold War brinksmanship","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d06df71cde65fc19bc1023d117863b6c8d16c96","amp;dn":"The+Blood+Telegram%3A+Nixon%2C+Kissinger+and+a+Forgotten+Genocide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d06df71cde65fc19bc1023d117863b6c8d16c96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,6,223,113,205,230,95,193,155,193,2,61,17,120,99,182,200,209,108,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
