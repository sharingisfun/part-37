This is a MAGNiTUDE release. Tested on windows x64 versions of 8, 8.1, and 10. \n\nIn addition to its precise 3D data processing functions Geomagic Studio incorporates incredible automated tools, all of which enable users to produce the highest quality models in significantly less time and reduce costly man-hours.\n\nGeomagicÃ‚Â® ControlÃ¢â€žÂ¢\nGeomagic Control (formerly known as Geomagic QualifyÃ‚Â®) is the industryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most comprehensive, robust and accurate 3D metrology solution and automation platform.\n\nGeomagic Control delivers the highest accuracy, speed and comprehensive, automated reporting on the quality of as-built parts for first-article inspection, production inspection, and supplier management using CMM and laser scanning tools. The software delivers CAD importer tools and airfoil analysis at no charge to help manufacturers rapidly increase product and manufacturing quality, identify process issues and build productivity. Advanced GD&amp;T, probing and dimensional inspection functions enable fast and precise measurement of parts, and Geomagic Control includes intelligent creation of reports in 3D PDF.\n\nThe Geomagic Control Automation Platform delivers the power to streamline almost every process, reduce human interaction in measurements and recording, decrease measuring time, and markedly enhance R&amp;R results. Geomagic Control customers can dramatically cut production line downtime, increase accuracy and improve part quality during and after manufacturing.\n\nGeomagic WrapÃ‚Â®\nGeomagic Wrap delivers the industryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful toolbox to transform 3D scan data and imported files into 3D models for immediate use downstream. From engineering to entertainment, art to archeology and manufacturing to museums, people from every walk of life are effortlessly reverse engineering perfect 3D models from scan data and 3D files using Geomagic Wrap.\n\nRevolutionize Your 3D Workflows\nGeomagic Wrap delivers the most easy-to-use, affordable, fast, accurate path from point clouds to 3D polygonal and surface models that can be used instantly in downstream engineering, manufacturing, engineering, art, industrial design and more. As part of your 3D digital thread, Geomagic Wrap provides the digital bridge to allow you to create perfect data to use directly in 3D printing, milling, archiving and multiple other 3D uses.\n\nWith GeomagicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advanced Exact Surfacing tools included Geomagic Wrap delivers power yet ease-of-use in cutting-edge modeling functions for that flawless 3D model. Scripting and macros available also automate functions for repetitive tasks during the reverse engineering process.\n\nGeomagic Wrap enables users to transform point cloud data, probe data and imported 3D formats (STL, OBJ, etc.) into 3D polygon meshes for use in manufacturing, analysis, design, entertainment, archeology and analysis.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tHardware: The minimum hardware requirements are listed below.
