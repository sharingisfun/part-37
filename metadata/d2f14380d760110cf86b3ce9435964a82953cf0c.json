Brutal, extreme Death Metal? That's right. But the Black Forest quintet has three members of the Black metallers THE WAY OF FREEDOM in the ranks is not only extremely consistent, but also extremely well versed technically. &quot;Elements Of Instability&quot;, Album Numero two,shoots without mercy on all cylinders, that can be a fearful  and anxious. \n\nNECROPHAGIST you know any? On the combo I have not once think, thanks mainly to the complex riffs and solos of the many tech-savvy, which also provide the necessary splash of color. In the best moments even parallels to ATHEIST shine through, nachzuhÃƒÂ¶ren such as in 'retrogression'. The interplay between the band is definitely remarkable - which was just blasted flies the next break around the ears, followed by the wild magic strings and thunderous bass lines. The rough vocals (yes, there are still) Roman Hilsers shake in addition all the foundations. Anno 2014 defined FUCK YOU AND THE raises the bar for the extreme tech death, at least I have not heard nothing like it. So the album packs a or, uh, fuck you and die!\nTracklist:\n\n01. Security Through Obscurity\n02. Natural Death\n03. The Bitter, Not the Better\n04. Roar, Allay and Alter\n05. Retrogression\n06. State of Anxiety\n07. Self Inflicted Suffocation\n08. Bury Them by the Rivers\n09. Habitus Metus\n10. Elements of Instability\n\n\nMetal from a Metal/HardRock/Classic Uploader. Never to be found on my pages. Katy Perry Smiley Virus or Vermin van Burin(who is he)and many others who will disappear after the 15 seconds of &quot;Fame&quot; I dont care Im not a content whore. I  like and listen to the stuff I post thats why I post it. Understand?  Cool. Some reggae makes the cut and of course Johnny Cash.But its 90 percent Metal-Hard Rock.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2f14380d760110cf86b3ce9435964a82953cf0c","amp;dn":"Fuck+You+And+Die+-+Elements+Of+Instability+mp3++320k++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2f14380d760110cf86b3ce9435964a82953cf0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,241,67,128,215,96,17,12,248,107,60,233,67,89,100,168,41,83,207,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
