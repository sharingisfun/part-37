After their counselor exposes them to what they perceive as a cruel slaughter of corralled bison, these misfits are soon drawn to a common purpose to break free of their camp and free the bison. On their way to free the bison, individual flashbacks reveal the relationships each has with his own family and give insight to their reasons behind wanting to set the bison free. Karen and Richard Carpenter&amp;#039;s singing of the title song occurs now and again throughout the movie to underscore the the drama.\n\nSummary written by Patrick {King@englishking@hotmail.com}\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f3443c3afc534a7d53723c103b87a11ba52436","amp;dn":"Bless.the.Beasts.and.Children%281971-PG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f3443c3afc534a7d53723c103b87a11ba52436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,243,68,60,58,252,83,74,125,83,114,60,16,59,135,161,27,165,36,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
