At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since\n        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,\n         occasionally). Out goal is to satisfy those who like\n       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable\n        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.\n       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and\n         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are\n              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.\n                Remember, kids!
