By looking at the route propertie.xml you can tell all the packages that are needed to have every thing show in the route. Not one version of the torrents had it right. The scenarios were not proper as well. They are all edited to work properly with the canadian Nationals which are also included. This is quick drive compatible and has been working perfectly in TS2016 ind release. Everything is working with all images. This is truly a beautiful route when proper.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2938e5a680b00d56e18c7e59001c0493ac8561e","amp;dn":"Railworks+Fort+Kent+to+Eagle+Lake+w%2FCN+100%25+Proper%21+RWP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2938e5a680b00d56e18c7e59001c0493ac8561e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,147,142,90,104,11,0,213,110,24,199,229,144,1,192,73,58,200,86,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
