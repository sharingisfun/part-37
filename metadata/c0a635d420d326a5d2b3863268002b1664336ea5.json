New Vegas.\n\nIt's the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to\nbeing shot in the head and left for deadand that's before\nthings really get ugly. It's a town of dreamers and desperados\nbeing torn apart by warring factions vying for complete\ncontrol of this desert oasis. It's a place where the right\nkind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make\na name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two\nalong the way.\n\nAs you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave\nWasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched\nVegas Strip, you'll be introduced to a colorful cast of\ncharacters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated\ncreatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or\ndeclare &quot;winner takes all&quot; and crown yourself the King of New\nVegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year,\nFallout 3.\n\nEnjoy your stay.\n\nFeel the Heat in New Vegas Not even nuclear fallout could\nslow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the\ndesert wastelands - from the small towns dotting the Mojave\nWasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See\nthe Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout.\n\nFeuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles\nA war is brewing between rival factions with consequences\nthat will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New\nVegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with\ncountless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and\ndetermine the final explosive outcome of this epic power\nstruggle.\n\nNew Systems Enjoy new additions to Fallout: New Vegas such as\na Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions,\na Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your\nactions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the\nmeek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been\nadded to bring new meaning to the phrase &quot;up close and\npersonal&quot;. Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target\nspecific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right\nto the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat\nmechanics.\n\nAn Arsenal of Shiny New Guns With double the amount of\nweapons found in Fallout 3, you'll have more than enough new\nand exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland\nand the locals. In addition, Vault-Tec engineers have devised\na new weapons configuration system that lets you tinker with\nyour toys and see the modifications you make in real time.\n\nLet it Ride In a huge, open world with unlimited options you\ncan see the sights, choose sides, or go it alone. Peacemaker\nor Hard Case, House Rules, or the Wild Card - it's all in how\nyou play the game.\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1. Unpack release\n2. Mount image or burn it\n3. Install\n4.
