Opening with a triumphant duet with R&amp;B superstar Akon, &quot;Hold My Hand&quot; is an epic and soulful ballad with rich gospel undertones. Other guests include Lenny Kravitz on &quot;(I Can't Make It) Another Day&quot; and 50 Cent on the excellent &quot;Monster&quot;. For all the high-profile guests, it's Jackson himself who inevitably steals the show. The swing-influenced single, &quot;Breaking News&quot;, is an instant highlight, while the tear-jerking finale, &quot;Much Too Soon&quot;, is set to break hearts worldwide. With ten previously unreleased tracks, this optimistic collection doesn't dwell on poignancy, instead serving as a masterclass in catchy, three-minute gems.\n\nMichael completes the picture of a true talent. It's a fitting release of the highest magnitude from arguably the greatest pop star of all time.\n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\n   1.
