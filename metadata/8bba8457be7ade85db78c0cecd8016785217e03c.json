Dan lives in an apartment in back of the Desert Inn and his boss is the owner of the hotel, Phillip Roth. Dan is aided by his sexy, but efficient, secretary Bea Travis and his nerdy legman Bobby &quot;Binzer&quot; Borso. Dan's contact on the force is Lt. Dave Nelson.\n\nDan Tanna is a private investigator in the gambling town of Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas can be seedy or glamorous, depending upon the point of view. This show is also notable for perhaps the only known portrayal of a house with a &quot;drive-in&quot; living room.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bba8457be7ade85db78c0cecd8016785217e03c","amp;dn":"Vega%24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bba8457be7ade85db78c0cecd8016785217e03c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,186,132,87,190,122,222,133,219,120,192,206,205,128,22,120,82,23,224,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
