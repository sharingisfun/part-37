My mother named me William Jefferson Blythe III after my father, William Jefferson Blythe Jr., one of nine children of a poor farmer in Sherman, Texas, who died when my father was seventeen. According to his sisters, my father always tried to take care of them, and he grew up tobe a handsome, hardworking, fun-loving man. He met my mother at Tri-State Hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1943, when she was training to be a nurse. Many times when I was growing up, I asked Mother to tell me the story of their meeting, courting, and marriage. He brought a date with some kind of medical emergency into the ward where she was working, and they talked and flirted while the other woman was being treated. On his way out of the hospital, he touched the finger on which she was wearing her boyfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ring and asked her if she was married. She stammeered no, she was single. The next day he sent the other woman flowers and her heart sank. Then he called Mother for a date, explaining that he always sent flowers when he ended a relationship.\n\nPublisher: Randomhouse Audio\nRead by Bill Clinton\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVisit us at our new site for the latest audiobook releases and loads more!!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.audiobook-vault.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.audiobook-vault.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d02fff96d69174f46d51d1c901461da0e81920","amp;dn":"Bill+Clinton+-+My+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d02fff96d69174f46d51d1c901461da0e81920","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,208,47,255,150,214,145,116,244,109,81,209,201,1,70,29,160,232,25,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
