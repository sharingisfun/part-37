The film's full on-screen title is Home of the Brave: A Film by Laurie Anderson. The performances were filmed at the Park Theater in Union City, NJ, during the summer of 1985.\n\nThe film included appearances by guitarist Adrian Belew, author William S. Burroughs (who famously briefly dances a slow tango with Anderson during one song), keyboardist Joy Askew, and percussionist David Van Tieghem. Also, Barry Sonnenfeld, who was early in his movie-making career, receives an early film credit for operating second projection camera on this film. \n\nCollected Videos is a VHS tape (never officially released on DVD) that contains a sampling of Laurie Anderson's various concerts, music videos, interviews, and more.\n\n--- ALSO ---\n\nDo you like oldies?
