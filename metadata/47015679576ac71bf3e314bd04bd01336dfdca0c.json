(The District)\n\nReleased: 2004\n\nDirector: Aron Gauder\n\nCountry: Hungary\n\n!!!Language: Hungarian!!! (Romany and English too, says IMDB)\n\nDuration: 1h 26min 19sec\n\n\nThis is a fantastic hungarian animation. It has plenty of that ghetto, hiphop flavor to it plus it features time travel and anti-Bush philosophy. Hotttt!\n\nIve seen it on Animateka - international animation film festival in Ljubljana, Slovenia. It had english subtitles, but they were printed on the 35mm film together with the animation. Cant find the divx subtitles on the web though, and Hungarian... I dont understand a word. And Im dying to see it again!\n\nIf somebody out there finds the English subtitles I would be infinitly greatful if a link was posted here as a comment. Italian, Slovenian or Croatian is also OK, I can translate from these languages to English.\n\n\nVideo info:\nSize: 576 x 320\nFrame rate: 25fps\nData rate: 137kbps\nSample size: 12 bit\nCompression: XVID\n\nAudio Info:\nFormat: MP3\nBit rate: 129kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47015679576ac71bf3e314bd04bd01336dfdca0c","amp;dn":"Nyocker.2004.Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47015679576ac71bf3e314bd04bd01336dfdca0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,1,86,121,87,106,199,27,243,227,20,189,4,189,1,51,109,253,202,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
