The recording sessions started in 1973 at his 100-acre (40 ha) farm in Wales with his band &quot;Slim Chance&quot;, using Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio. The album has more of a rootsy, folk-rock sound than his early recordings with Faces.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395a147e53bf301dc7594776c84f5aec0cb8f002","amp;dn":"Ronnie+Lane+%26amp%3B+the+band+%27Slim+Chance%27+%26lrm%3B-+Anymore+For+Anym","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395a147e53bf301dc7594776c84f5aec0cb8f002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,90,20,126,83,191,48,29,199,89,71,118,200,79,90,236,12,184,240,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
