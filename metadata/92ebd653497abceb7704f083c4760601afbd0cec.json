An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings, however, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit, &quot;Move It&quot; (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock &amp; roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these, although it was by no means one of the more successful, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad &quot;Blue Turns to Grey&quot;).\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/cliff-richard-p5265/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/cliff-richard-p5265/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-platinum-collection-r812779&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-platinum-collection-r812779&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BEPLS6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BEPLS6&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
