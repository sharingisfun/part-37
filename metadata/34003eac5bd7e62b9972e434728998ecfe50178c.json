He is a triple threatÃ¢â‚¬â€beautiful singer, fine songwriter, and killer guitarist. Most of those talents are showcased on his new disc Natural Born Days. Malone has a fantastic voice. It is soulful and gritty at points, and simply pretty at others. It is an instrument that easily conveys both the rueful and redemptive tone of the songs here. Even though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not singing the capital Ã¢â‚¬Å“BÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Blues here, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing the blues with shadings and nuance in his vocal lines. The songs here cover a wide range but are never get so far from Malone that they sound awkward. Malone wrote most of the songs here with people he has known or worked with for several decades such as his band mates in the subdudes Johnny Allen and Tim Cook and old friend and drummer Jim Scheurich, so these songs possess a vulnerability that can result from such comfort. Songs such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“DistanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ have a depth and sensitivity that most songwriters canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fathom. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just a ballad-heavy set of songs. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Creedence-like rocker in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mississippi BootleggerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a honky-tonk beat to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Important to Me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ There could have been more of MaloneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s excellent guitar work on this disc, but that might have taken away from the emphasis on the songs and vocals. However it pops up with his slide work on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life Goes OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a beautiful lead on Ã¢â‚¬Å“God Knows.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Natural Born Days sounds like the Tommy Malone that his fans love and his soon-to-be fans will be happy to get to know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34003eac5bd7e62b9972e434728998ecfe50178c","amp;dn":"Tommy+Malone+-+Natural+Born+Days+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34003eac5bd7e62b9972e434728998ecfe50178c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,0,62,172,91,215,230,43,153,114,228,52,114,137,152,236,254,80,23,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
