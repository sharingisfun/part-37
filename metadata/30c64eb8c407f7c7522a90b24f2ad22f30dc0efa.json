Ray has no idea why this is because he was told he had an allergy to light.  He also pines for Jenny Jurden a girl he grew up with.  She was the love of his life having not met any other girls.  She is also very sweet and wasn't scared of Ray and treated him kindly.  Now that Ray has control of his powers he goes and sees her but there are others who are watching him including it seems his father whom Ray believes is dead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30c64eb8c407f7c7522a90b24f2ad22f30dc0efa","amp;dn":"The+Ray+%2801+-+06%29+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30c64eb8c407f7c7522a90b24f2ad22f30dc0efa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,198,78,184,196,7,247,199,82,42,144,178,79,42,210,47,48,220,14,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
