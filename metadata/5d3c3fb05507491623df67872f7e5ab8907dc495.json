Released in September 2001, it is the follow up to the previous year&amp;#039;s Civil Disobedients. The songs are a mix of hardcore and the ska-core sound. The lyrics in the album show a positive attitude towards life and lyrical themes include overcoming tough situations and racism (the song &quot;Judgement Days&quot;). &quot;Dub #2&quot; is the only instrumental and almost all the tracks have sax playing from singer Jake. It was released on London-based indie label Household Name Records and hit 48 in the UK charts (the highest charting release on the label). Pound for the Sound received critical acclaim from publications such as Kerrang! who described it as &quot;damn near perfect&quot; and awarded it 4 K&amp;#039;s out of 5.\n\n1. Faith No More\n2.
