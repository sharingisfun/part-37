Hungry for the brand of wild adventure only available off-planet, Eddie joins up with a crew of a rock-hopping freighter, eager to see what lies beyond the clouds. As these things tend to go, however, everything in these early days of interstellar travel isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite what it seems as intrigue and mystery abound. Byrne also stated that this story takes place in the same universe as Next Men.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3cf44873dc697a9d8c3543428ec1e9d2ee962c7","amp;dn":"The+High+Ways+04+%28of+04%29+%282013%29+%28Digital%29+%28G85-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3cf44873dc697a9d8c3543428ec1e9d2ee962c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,207,68,135,61,198,151,169,216,195,84,52,40,236,30,157,46,233,98,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
