Bosma (Elsevier, 1993).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0444815341\r\n\r\nThe 70 papers collected in this volume present an up to date review of the trends in heat pump technology. The heat pump is reviewed both as being part of a more comprehensive system, and as a refined device providing energy and greenhouse gas emission reductions. Its implementation in a system or process must be carefully considered at an early stage of design or development, and process integration is discussed in detail as a valuable tool for industry.\r\nThe heat pump is proving to be a highly effective energy conserving tool, particularly when designed and used as an integral part of a system. Environmental benefits are gained when energy is conserved, and heat pumps can make a major contribution in this area. However, some heat pumps use working fluids which are environmentally unfriendly, and the progress that has been made in the field of alternative refrigerants is reported on. The volume will prove an indispensable reference source on the wide-ranging applications that have been developed since the last international conference, on such topics as heat pump field trials, pilot plants and development programmes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b39c8297a95f8d831b8b604c562be353ff94624","amp;dn":"Heat+Pumps+for+Energy+Efficiency+and+Environmental+Progress","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b39c8297a95f8d831b8b604c562be353ff94624","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,57,200,41,122,149,248,216,49,184,182,4,197,98,190,53,63,249,70,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
