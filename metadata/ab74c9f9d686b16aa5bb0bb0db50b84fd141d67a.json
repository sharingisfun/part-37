The New Orleans rock trio Randy Jackson, Felix Hanemann and Guy Gelso. If you even fleetingly recall the Zep pop of the first Zebra record (for example, &quot;Tell Me What You Want&quot; and &quot;Who's Behind the Door?&quot;), then definitely pick up this economic and stellar double-shot disc, housing no less than 20 tracks of AOR guilty pleasure from the trio's second and third. Zebra is the best of the Zeppelin clones, completely shedding their influence on the uncelebrated 3.V (and there's plenty of good rock to be had on No Tellin' Lies as well). ~ Doug Stone, All Music Guide \n\nTrack listing \n1.
