As the game progresses, players will be able to train manage up to 30 fighters at the same time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ only if they are successful and form talented amateurs into hardened professionals will they be able to earn coveted titles in all the well-known weight classes.\n\nOf course, managers will always have to have an eye on their finances: does he have the funds to take on better staff in order to improve training? Can he promote his boxing events with TV ads, drawing crowds and earning big bucks, or will he have to make do with a small note in the local papers?
