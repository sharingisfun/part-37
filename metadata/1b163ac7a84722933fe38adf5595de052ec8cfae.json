Those are going to be the two questions you ask yourself when you watch this brand new series. A Christmas tree, a pair of shears, the spike on top of a set of railings, and a full set of cutlery!? All of these foreign objects have somehow inserted themselves into someone. We talk to the victims, eye-witnesses, recreate the gory accidents and show you the gruesome x-rays that show where those bodies got invaded. And, more importantly, how the medical professionals managed to extract the objects and save the victims' lives.\n\nIn Scotland, a woman leaves for work and five minutes later ends up with her head impaled on a thirteen centimeter iron spike. In Australia, a young father goes fishing with friends. One of them accidentally shoots him with a spear a metre and half long and our hero nearly dies on a remote beach. Nowhere is safe, as a 86 year- old American pottering around his garden discovers when he falls on his garden shears. They get lodged in his eye, with the handle right beside a vital artery. This episode delves in to the strange, but true world, of unlucky encounters with deadly body invaders. It's crammed full of useful information about what to do in these extreme situations - the most important advice is &quot;Don't pull it out&quot;. Thanks to the skill of the doctors, the stories are crowned with heart-warming resolutions to the most desperate situations.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img802/1249/dontpullitoutscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img802/1249/dontpullitoutscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/8812/dontpullitoutscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/8812/dontpullitoutscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img809/1224/dontpullitoutscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img809/1224/dontpullitoutscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/1116/dontpullitoutscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/1116/dontpullitoutscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/1802/dontpullitoutscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/1802/dontpullitoutscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/6382/dontpullitoutscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/6382/dontpullitoutscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img833/8271/dontpullitoutscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img833/8271/dontpullitoutscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img827/4533/dontpullitoutscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img827/4533/dontpullitoutscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img51/5039/dontpullitoutscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img51/5039/dontpullitoutscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2137 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 44.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.entertainment-focus.com/news/%E2%80%98body-invaders%E2%80%99-to-premiere-on-discovery-channel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.entertainment-focus.com/news/%E2%80%98body-invaders%E2%80%99-to-premiere-on-discovery-channel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b163ac7a84722933fe38adf5595de052ec8cfae","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Body+Invaders+Dont+Pull+it+Out+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b163ac7a84722933fe38adf5595de052ec8cfae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,22,58,199,168,71,34,147,63,227,138,223,85,149,222,5,46,200,207,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
