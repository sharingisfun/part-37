Initially, Faust does not rise to the bait presented by Mephistopheles' assistants who encode their offers in commuter-maps handed out at a Prague subway exit. Instead he accidently calls Mephistopheles himself. With the Devil's favorite minion, Faust agrees to sell his soul in exchange for 24 pleasure-filled years. The bargain is sealed, but Faust doesn't get what he bargained for. First he is turned into an actor, then he is turned into a puppet.\n\n\nLanguage: Czech\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f724334cdb404ba565ccc48dca86ffcd769f8acd","amp;dn":"Faust+1994+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f724334cdb404ba565ccc48dca86ffcd769f8acd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,36,51,76,219,64,75,165,101,204,196,141,202,134,255,205,118,159,138,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
