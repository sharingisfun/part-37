However, this particular release is different than expected. Listeners who hope to hear extended solos and riotous ensembles are sure to be disappointed with Under One Roof, for much of the time Roomful of Blues sounds like an anonymous backup group put together specifically to accompany singer Sugar Ray Norcia. Norcia is a versatile and talented singer, and his repertoire ranges from a Basie blues to tunes that are closer to rock, soul and even country. If one comes to this CD without false expectations, the music is enjoyable on its own level, but from a jazz standpoint, the release is rather routine and not very significant. - Review by Scott Yanow, allmusic.com\n\n\n\n\nRoomful Of Blues - Under One Roof\nLabel: Bullseye Blues - BB 9569\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: US\nReleased: 1997\nGenre: Blues\nStyle: Modern Electric Blues, Jump Blues\n \n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 \tShe'll Be So Fine \t\n2 \tRunning Out Of Time \t\n3 \tWe B 3 \t\n4 \tStanding Here At The Crossroads \t\n5 \tSmack Dab In The Middle \t\n6 \tLet Me Live \t\n7 \tStill Livin' In Prison \t\n8 \tSwitchen' In The Kitchen \t\n9 \tFrom You \t\n10 \tQ's Blues \t\n11 \tEasy Baby \t\n12 \tFarmer John \t\n13 \tBaby, Baby, Baby \t\n14 \tRogue Elephant\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nBob Enos - Trumpet\nKen &quot;Doc&quot; Grace - Bass\nDoug James - Sax (Baritone)\nRich Lataille - Sax (Alto), Sax (Tenor)\nMatt McCabe - Piano\nSugar Ray Norcia - Harmonica, Vocals\nCarl Querfurth - Trombone\nJohn Rossi - Drums\nChris Vachon - Guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a3a4391dcd2ef01a62954600858416c4af3f1d","amp;dn":"Roomful+Of+Blues+-+Under+One+Roof+%281997%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a3a4391dcd2ef01a62954600858416c4af3f1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,163,164,57,29,205,46,240,26,98,149,70,0,133,132,22,196,175,63,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
