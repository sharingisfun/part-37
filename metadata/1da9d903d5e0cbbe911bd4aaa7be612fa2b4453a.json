When I was a kid my mom broke my first pressing copy of Doggystyle because of all the gangsta rap controversy at the time and I was only like 10/11 years old.\n\n\nAfter that every copy I came across was missing stuff or didn't &quot;flow&quot; right but i couldnt put my finger on it. Later on I found out about the track &quot;Gz Up, Hoes Down&quot; being taken off because of sample clearance issues and the misprint on the back cover. I finally bought a copy on ebay after never finding a proper rip or copy anywhere, and am now sharing it with all of you so you can experience this classic album the way it was meant to be experienced. No re-release, no &quot;remastered&quot; trash, no fake rip, just pure, original 1993.\n\nI hope to make this the most distributed copy of Doggystyle on and offline out of pure love for such a classic album so please pass it like a cold!\n\n\n\nENJOY!
