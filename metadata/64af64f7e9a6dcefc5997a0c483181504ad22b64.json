That run includes a rare home defeat for City boss Roberto Mancini in 2010, plus last season's game at Goodison Park, which Everton won thanks to a Darron Gibson goal.\n\nThe lunchtime kick-off is a London derby between West Ham and Chelsea at Upton Park. The Hammers have made an encouraging start to the season following their return to the top flight, but they have not beaten the Blues since 2003.\n\nThere is another London derby at Craven Cottage, where Fulham manager Martin Jol faces his former side Tottenham, while elsewhere in the capital Arsenal host Swansea.\n\nOther matches include Liverpool against Southampton, Queens Park Rangers against Aston Villa and West Brom versus Stoke, while the evening kick-off sees Reading entertain Manchester United.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64af64f7e9a6dcefc5997a0c483181504ad22b64","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+01.12.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64af64f7e9a6dcefc5997a0c483181504ad22b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,175,100,247,233,166,220,239,197,153,122,12,72,49,129,80,74,210,43,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
