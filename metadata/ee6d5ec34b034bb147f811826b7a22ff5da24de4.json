This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThere's a singer in the countdown who used to teach karate to the LA police department and joined the Marines at age 13.\n\nPaul Stookie, at number 24, was one third of Peter, Paul, and Mary.\n\nOkay, either Casey didn't say anything interesting, or I was busy milti-tasking and didn't pay much attention. So, a prize of five dollars will be awarded to the person who can put something in the comment section that was interesting about this countdown, other than the music was good, which it was. \n\n40: Long Ago And Far Away - James Taylor\n39: Natural Man - Lou Rawls\n38: Macarthur Park (Part 2) - Four Tops\n37: Woman's Love Rights - Laura Lee\n36: You've Got To Craw; Before You Walk - The Eighth Day\n35: Inner City Blues Make Me Wanna Holler - Marvin Gaye\n34: Only You Know And I Know - Delaney &amp; Bonnie\n33: The Story In Your Eyes - The Moody Blues\n32: One Fine Morning - Lighthouse\n31: Easy Lovin' - Freddie Hart\n30: The Love We Had Stays On My Mind - The Dells\n29: Make It Funky (Part 1) - James Brown\n28: Birds Of A Feather - The Raiders\n27: Loving Her Was Easier Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again - Kris Kristofferson\n26: Never My Love - 5th Dimension\n25: Stagger Lee - Tommy Roe\n24: Wedding Song (There Is Love) - Paul Stookie\n23: Rain Dance - The Guess Who\n22: Chirpie Chirpie Cheep Cheep - Mac And Katie Kissoon\n21: Spanish Harlem - Aretha Franklin\n20: Peace Train - Cat Stevens\n19: Stick-Up - Honeycone\n18: It's A Thin Line Between Love And Hate - The Persuaders\nSPECIAL: Run Around Sue - Dion\n17: I Woke Up I Love This Morning - The Partridge Family\n16: Trapped By A Thing Called Love - Denise Lasalle\n15: I've Found Someone Of My Own - Free Movement\nEXTRA: Every Picture Tells A Story - Rod Stewart\nSPECIAL: Don't Be Cruel - Elvis Presley\n14: So Far Away - Carole King\n13: Tired Of Being Alone - Al Green\n12: Smiling Faces Sometimes - Undisputed Truth\n11: Gypsies, Tramps &amp; Thieves - Cher\n10: Sweet City Woman - Stampeders\n9: Ain't No Sunshine - Bill Withers\n8: If You Really Love Me - Stevie Wonder\n7: Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey - Wings\n6: Do You Know What I Mean - Lee Michaels\n5: Go Away Little Girl - Donny Osmond\n4: The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down - Joan Baez\n3: Yo-Yo - The Osmonds\n2: Superstar - Carpenters\n1: Maggie May - Rod Stewart\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee6d5ec34b034bb147f811826b7a22ff5da24de4","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1971_October_16th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee6d5ec34b034bb147f811826b7a22ff5da24de4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,109,94,195,75,3,75,177,71,248,17,130,107,122,34,255,93,162,77,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
