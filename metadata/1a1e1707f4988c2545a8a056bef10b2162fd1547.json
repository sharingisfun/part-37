Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by the English rock group The Beatles, released in June 1967. Recorded over a 129-day period beginning in December 1966, Sgt. Pepper sees the band exploring further the experimentation of their previous album, Revolver (1966). Making use of orchestras, hired musicians and innovative production techniques, the album incorporates elements of genres such as music hall, jazz, rock and roll, western classical and traditional Indian music; its lyrics deal particularly with themes of childhood and everyday life. Sgt. Pepper is a loose concept album that sees The Beatles performing as the fictitious band of the album's title. The cover art, depicting the band posing in front of a collage of famous individuals, has itself been widely acclaimed and imitated. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a commercial success, spending a total of 27 weeks at the top of the UK Album Chart and 15 weeks at number one on the American Billboard 200. A defining album in the emerging psychedelic rock style, Sgt. Pepper was critically acclaimed upon release and won four Grammy awards in 1968. In 2003, the album was placed at number 1 in the Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAmazon.com - Digitally remastered digipak edition of this classic 1967 album from The Beatles featuring 'Lucy In The Sky WIth Diamonds', 'With A Little Help From My Friends', 'A Day In The Life', 'Getting Better, 'When I'm Sixty Four' and many more.

Sgt. Pepper, in many ways, refines that breakthrough, as the Beatles consciously synthesized such disparate influences as psychedelia, art-song, classical music, rock &amp; roll, and music hall, often in the course of one song. Not once does the diversity seem forced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the genius of the record is how the vaudevillian &quot;When I'm 64&quot; seems like a logical extension of &quot;Within You Without You&quot; and how it provides a gateway to the chiming guitars of &quot;Lovely Rita.&quot; There's no discounting the individual contributions of each member or their producer, George Martin, but the preponderance of whimsy and self-conscious art gives the impression that Paul McCartney is the leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band. He dominates the album in terms of compositions, setting the tone for the album with his unabashed melodicism and deviously clever arrangements. In comparison, Lennon's contributions seem fewer, and a couple of them are a little slight but his major statements are stunning. &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; is the ideal Ringo tune, a rolling, friendly pop song that hides genuine Lennon anguish, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la &quot;Help!&quot;; &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot; remains one of the touchstones of British psychedelia; and he's the mastermind behind the bulk of &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; a haunting number that skillfully blends Lennon's verse and chorus with McCartney's bridge. It's possible to argue that there are better Beatles albums, yet no album is as historically important as this. After Sgt. Pepper, there were no rules to follow ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse. Ironically, few tried to achieve the sweeping, all-encompassing embrace of music as the Beatles did here. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Sgt.
