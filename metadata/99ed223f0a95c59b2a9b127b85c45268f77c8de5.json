Each issue came with a cover mounted disk containing software.\n\nIt was published by the same company that published the Your Commodore magazine and was aimed at Commodore users that had a 1541 disk drive and did not want to have to type in program listings. It also meant that larger programs could be included with the magazine. Initially, an issue of the magazine was published every two months but after two years, it was changed to being published every month.\n\nThe magazine survived up until the end of 1991; the last issue cover dated October 1991.\n\nFrequency Monthly \n\nFirst issue: November 1987 \n\nFinal issue: October 1991\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99ed223f0a95c59b2a9b127b85c45268f77c8de5","amp;dn":"Commodore+DiskUser+100%25+%28All+36+Issues%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99ed223f0a95c59b2a9b127b85c45268f77c8de5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,237,34,63,10,149,197,155,42,155,18,123,133,196,82,104,247,124,141,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
