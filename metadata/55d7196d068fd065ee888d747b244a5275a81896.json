The player takes on the role of the ruler of a civilization, starting with only one settler unit, and attempts to build an empire in competition with between two and six other civilizations.\n\nThis is the 1991 game that started it all. Still one of the greatest games of all time. As simple as it is it is still addicting. \n\nNOTE\nThis version will NOT run on 64-bit systems (Windows 7, Vista) but will run on Windows XP or any Older windows OS\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d7196d068fd065ee888d747b244a5275a81896","amp;dn":"Sid+Meier%5C%27s+Civilization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d7196d068fd065ee888d747b244a5275a81896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,215,25,109,6,143,208,101,238,136,141,116,123,36,74,82,117,168,24,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
