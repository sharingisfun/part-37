Dog Barking At The Moon\n\nNearly three years since announcing their arrival with debut mini album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœForward MarchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and a series of shows that saw Uncut declare the band Ã¢â‚¬ËœGodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own orchestraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and NME go goggle eyed at their Ã¢â‚¬Ëœapocalyptic preachingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ The Strange Death Of Liberal England return with their full length debut album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDrown Your Heart AgainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nRecorded with producer Dave Allen (The Cure, Depeche Mode) at the helm after he tracked down the band and with a crew including the massed brass, strings and percussion of The Richard P Horne Youth Orchestra at The Old BlacksmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Studio in Portsmouth, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDrown Your Heart AgainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is an album lyrically steeped in the coastal environment from which it sprung, musically shot through with elements of mariachi brass, military drums, sweeping strings, punching brass and psychedelic echoes. It is a full return on the early promise many identified on Ã¢â‚¬ËœForward MarchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, intelligent, experimental, but, at heart, a pop record.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœDrown Your Heart AgainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the product of the eighteen months following last single, Ã¢â‚¬ËœAngelouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that saw the band remove themselves from public view. With the benefit of experience from their first taste of band life and a unified decision to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnot take the long way roundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the words of lead singer and lyricist Adam Woolway the album was crystallised by the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one public performance in that time, a sold out, fully seated, orchestral show with The Richard P Horne Youth Orchestra at PortsmouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New Theatre Royal that set the tone and bar for the album sessions.\n\nTo call the album a labour of love would not be amiss. The studio gave free time, Dave Allen lived in a camper van outside it for the duration of the sessions (that later was used in a car-bombing at a Nissan garage in High Wycombe but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another story), the orchestra gave their time for free, making Ã¢â‚¬ËœDrown Your Heart AgainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the product of a community.\n\nThe Strange Death Of Liberal England are Adam Woolway (vocals / guitar), William Charlton (guitars), Andrew Wright (glockenspiel / keys / percussion), Kelly Jones (bass guitars), David Lindsay (drums).\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d43bfd53689e67c80c18829c87deb74cea937b","amp;dn":"The+Strange+Death+of+Liberal+England...Drown+Your+Heart+Again%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d43bfd53689e67c80c18829c87deb74cea937b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,212,59,253,83,104,158,103,200,12,24,130,156,135,222,183,76,234,147,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
