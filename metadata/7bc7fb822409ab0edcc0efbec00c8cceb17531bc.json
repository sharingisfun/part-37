Learning to be a software engineer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ learning about software \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ learning about engineering (the former, a nebulous topic, the latter an equally nebulous attitude of \nprofessionalism) form the target that educators are aiming to hit. Unfortunately, with constant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinnovationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nin methodologies, technologies, and programming languages, this is a moving target. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe great aim of education is not knowledge but action.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) \nSimply put, the aim of this book is to better prepare educators to better prepare students to be better \nsoftware engineers. The material in the 18 chapters of this book hits the mark by providing proven ammunition \nfor student learning and assessment, curriculum development, innovative teaching methods, \nand project approaches that solidify classroom concepts, as well as instill an engineering mindset with \nrespect to responsibility, ethics, certification and licensing. It provides a synergistic experience base that \ncan serve the ongoing and future needs of software engineering educators. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNothing can add more power to your life than concentrating all your energies on a limited set of targets.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nNido Qubein \nTo paraphrase Yogi Berra, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoftware engineering is 90% aptitude, and the other half attitude.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In my \nopinion, one of the main challenges facing software engineering educators today is finding a formula \nfor a curriculum that balances theory and application ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that channels a studentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aptitude and enhances \ntheir ability and capability to be a software engineer. As stated earlier, software is a nebulous topic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not \nall software applications require the same engineering tradeoffs, but there are key engineering concepts \nthat can be distilled from the experience of others, as captured in the chapters of this book, which will \nhelp guide educators in defining and refining software engineering curriculum. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAim for success, not perfection. Never give up your right to be wrong, because then you will lose your \nability to learn new things and move forward with your life.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Dr. David M. Burns \nPerfection is the seductive goal of all software engineering projects - yet perfection has a price \nthat can stand in the way of a successful software solution. The readers of this book will clearly learn \nnew things that I am convinced will lead to success in the classroom that will, in turn, lead to more \nsuccessful engineering graduates, that will, in turn lead to more successful engineering projects. \nIn closing, there is one phrase that I first heard used jokingly when I entered the job market only \n4 years after the term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoftware EngineeringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was coined ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReady, Fire, Aim.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ At the time, I did \nnot appreciate its profound applicability to the real world. Software Engineering is the real world. \nAcademia is not, and there lies the challenge that this book addresses. Metaphorically speaking, the \nmaterial in this book will help educators get ready for software engineering students to learn as well \nas the educators themselves to teach (by providing a survey of existing learning theories and blended \nlearning approaches as they apply to software engineering education), it will help give educators the \nammunition they need to build their software engineering programs and capstone projects (leading \nto accreditation and more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œexperiencedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ students, who can better communicate and work in teams), \nand finally, it better prepares the students to successfully hit the (moving) target (by giving them an \nappreciation of ethics and professionalism that they can take outside the classroom).
