The release Making the Road sparked sold-out Japan shows and US/European tours with punk bands such as NOFX, No Use for a Name and WIZO. Although members of Hi-Standard were Japanese born, all of the band's major releases were sung in English. Live footage of the band shows them talking to the crowd in their native Japanese and then immediately changing to English for the songs.\n\nAfter recording five albums, the band entered a hiatus in August 2000, shortly after playing &quot;Air Jam 2000&quot;. Ken Yokoyama began working on other projects, including BBQ CHICKENS. Yokoyama revisited the bands original label Pizza of Death Records, which has since signed many punk and alternative rock bands. Akihiro Nanba's newest project is Ultra Brain. According to CDJapan, Nanba proclaims their debut album, Neo Punk, to be the birth of neo punk.[1] Akira Tsuneoka now provides the drums for the group Cubismo Grafico Five.\n\nIt has been announced that the band will be playing Air Jam 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing Up 1996\n\n\n\nGrowing Up is the debut album from Japanese punk rock band, Hi-Standard. It was released on an American label, Fat Wreck Chords, in February 1996.\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Summer of Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:47\n2.\t&quot;Wait for the Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n3.\t&quot;Who'll Be the Next&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n4.\t&quot;Lonely&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n5.\t&quot;Saturday Night&quot; (Coulter, Martin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:06\n6.\t&quot;I'm Walkin'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:07\n7.\t&quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43\n8.\t&quot;Growing Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:00\n9.\t&quot;Tell Me Something, Happy News&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:02\n10.\t&quot;New Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:46\n11.\t&quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; (Ballard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:06\n12.\t&quot;Kiss Me Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n13.\t&quot;Sunny Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n14.\t&quot;In the Brightly Moonlight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2dd7197a5c7048846b451d927ec2e71ce76f56f","amp;dn":"Hi-Standard+-+Growing+Up+1996+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2dd7197a5c7048846b451d927ec2e71ce76f56f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,221,113,151,165,199,4,136,70,180,81,217,39,236,46,113,206,118,245,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
