He seems to have a great ability to connect with his audience whether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talking about status anxiety, philosophy, travel, happiness or how Proust can change your life.\n\nHis critics deride his attempts to make complex ideas more accessible and entertaining to his readers but there was no evidence at this event, that this audience felt patronised in any way.\n\nHe declares his atheism from the outside and his firm belief that Ã¢â‚¬Å“there is no godÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and goes on to talk about being Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfully humanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and being able to Ã¢â‚¬Å“lead a good lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ outside of any formal religious structure. He has strong praise for the many formal aspects of religion and suggests these can be extracted , Ã¢â‚¬Å“picked and mixedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and applied to aspects of art, culture and education.\n\nHe sits, he says at the softer end of atheism; heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no Ã¢â‚¬Å“hard core atheistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ like his friend from North Oxford, Richard Dawkins.\n\nFor more information on this episode, including information on the guests and various other resources and links, visit the episode webpage\n\n-----\n\nNote: This is a MP4 video podcast that is available for free download from the website.
