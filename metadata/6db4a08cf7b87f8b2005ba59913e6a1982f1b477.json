They were influenced by punk rock bands of the '80s like Suicidal Tendencies (which featured some of the members of Uncle Slam and The Brood), D.R.I., Corrosion of Conformity, Black Flag and the Circle Jerks, as well as heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Slayer and MotÃƒÂ¶rhead. Many of their songs are about politics, rebel themes, death, pain and violence.[1] Uncle Slam has released four studio albums (one was recorded under their original name) and four demo tapes (one was also recorded under their original name). The band broke up in 1995 but in 2010 they reissued their 1988 album Say Uncle on CD for the first time.[2]\n\nContents\n\n    1 History\n    2 Members\n        2.1 Timeline\n    3 Discography\n        3.1 Studio albums\n        3.2 Demos\n    4 References\n    5 External links\n\nHistory\n\nUncle Slam originally formed in 1984 under the name The Brood by vocalists and guitarists Jon Nelson, Todd Moyer, bassist John Flitcraft, and former Suicidal Tendencies drummer Amery Smith. After releasing their self-titled debut album in 1986, the band changed their name to Uncle Slam in 1987.\n\nFlitcraft quit the band before they changed their name and was replaced by Louiche Mayorga, who previously played bass alongside Smith in Suicidal Tendencies, but also soon left. He was briefly replaced by Bob Heathcote (who would later join Suicidal Tendencies) before Simon Oliver finally joined shortly after.\n\nThe first &quot;Uncle Slam&quot; album was Say Uncle, released in 1988 through Caroline Records. Before the band could work on a follow-up to that album, Oliver left Uncle Slam in 1989 and was replaced by Angelo Espino.\n\nAfter Oliver returned in 1991, the band released their second album under the Uncle Sam name, Will Work for Food, in 1993 through Restless Records. Smith departed the band the following year and was replaced by another former Suicidal Tendencies member, R. J. Herrera. With the lineup of Moyer, Oliver, and Herrera, the band recorded and released their third and final album, When God Dies, in 1995 through Medusa Records. The band broke up that same year.\n\nAfter Smith's departure from Uncle Slam, he resurfaced in two bands, the Beastie Boys and BS 2000. He is now in AgainST, formed by Excel singer Dan Clements and former Suicidal Tendencies members Grant Estes, Amery Smith and Louiche Mayorga.\nMembers\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n    &quot;Weirdo Man&quot;\n    &quot;The Ugly Dude&quot;\n    &quot;Judgment Day&quot;\n    &quot;Micro Logic&quot;\n    &quot;Contaminated&quot;\n    &quot;Up From Beneath&quot;\n    &quot;Executioner&quot;\n    &quot;The Prophecy&quot;\n    &quot;Say Uncle&quot;\n    &quot;Immolation&quot;\n    &quot;Eve of the End&quot;\n    &quot;Come Alive&quot;\n\nAlbum artwork by Michael Seiff, who also did front covers of Join the Army by Suicidal Tendencies and their 1985 Compilation album Welcome to Venice.\n\nLast line-up\n\n    Todd Moyer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar and backing vocals (1984Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995)\n    Simon Oliver Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1989, 1991Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995)\n    R.
