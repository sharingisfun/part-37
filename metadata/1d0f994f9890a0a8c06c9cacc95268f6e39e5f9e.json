Some think they should be legal. Three world leaders want to make it happen. \n\nUntil one of them is assassinated. \n\nDisgraced MI6 spymaster Madeleine Wraye knows just the man to track a killer and keep the remaining two reformers alive. But her exceptional protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, Simon Arkell, hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been seen in nine years. And thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another problem: the assassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orders may be coming from someone dangerously close to home. \nThe Day of the Jackal meets Tinker, Tailor in an explosive mix of espionage, conspiracy, narcotics and betrayal. The War on Drugs is lost: who will survive the final battle? \n\n\n&quot;Elegant and ingenious, it delivers exactly what it promises Ã¢â‚¬â€ a spy story in the grand tradition&quot; - Daily Mail \n\n&quot;Rogue Elements is a beguiling throwback to the espionage fiction of yesteryear... striking characters and vivid action&quot; - Sunday Times\n\n(sb req)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d0f994f9890a0a8c06c9cacc95268f6e39e5f9e","amp;dn":"Rogue+Elements+-+Hector+Macdonald","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d0f994f9890a0a8c06c9cacc95268f6e39e5f9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,15,153,79,152,144,160,168,192,108,156,172,201,82,104,246,227,158,95,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
