As such, you may wonder why anybody would need a\nthird party disc burning tool. But glance through the features and\noptions available in Roxio Toast 11 Titanium, and you quickly\nstart to understand just what is missing from the Mac OS.\n\nA slightly re-designed interface makes it easier than ever to\nnavigate through Toast?s various options. In addition to standard\ndisc burning tools, there is also an impressively easy to use\nbackup app that can be used to secure your files - but the main\nfocus of the suite is on getting creative with your media files\nAs such, it is easy to create audio, video and photo-based discs\nand even create covers and labels for them. Audio and video can be\ncaptured from a variety of sources including web sites and\ncamcorders, and there are a number of conversion options available\n- including the ability to optimise video for display on iOS\ndevices. Support for multiple burners means that creating several\ncopies of the same disc is now faster than ever.\n\nNote that Toast 11.1 ships with a whole host of improvements,\nincluding full support for Mountain Lion, Retina user-interface\nand much more.\n\nLanguages: EN/FR/DE/IT/JP/PT/RU/ES/ZH\n\n\n..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..\n\nUse our keymaker to register the application.\n\nNOTE: Ignore the compress files named &quot;trips-utopia*missing&quot;\n\n\nThanks for choosing\n(C)hallenge (O)f (R)everse (E)ngineering!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee0d0e9dca0f3882b2fddd8cd3dccaefc62e8c8","amp;dn":"Roxio+Toast+Titanium+v11.1.1072+Multilingual+MacOSX+Incl+Keymake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee0d0e9dca0f3882b2fddd8cd3dccaefc62e8c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,224,208,233,220,160,243,136,43,47,221,216,205,61,204,174,252,98,232,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
