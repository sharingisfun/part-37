Implicit in efforts to go green is the promise that global warming can be stopped by swapping out dirty goods for &quot;clean&quot; ones. But can earth-friendly products really save the planet? This far-reaching, riveting narrative explores how the most readily available solutions to environmental crisis may be disastrously off the mark. Rogers travels the world tracking how the conversion from a &quot;petro&quot; to a &quot;green&quot; society affects the most fundamental aspects of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½food, shelter, and transportation. Reporting from some of the most remote places on earth, Rogers uncovers shocking results that include massive clear-cutting, destruction of native ecosystems, and grinding poverty. Relying simply on market forces, people with good intentions wanting to just &quot;do something&quot; to help the planet are left feeling confused and powerless.\nIn epub, enjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba4cce94452548609c3ca5280d9a770cf7fb426a","amp;dn":"Green+Gone+Wrong%3A+How+Our+Economy+is+Undermining+the+Environment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba4cce94452548609c3ca5280d9a770cf7fb426a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,76,206,148,69,37,72,96,156,60,165,40,13,154,119,12,247,251,66,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
