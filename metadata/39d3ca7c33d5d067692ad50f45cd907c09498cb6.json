Charles PellegrinoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scientific authority and close relationship with the A-bombÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s survivors make his account the most gripping and authoritative ever written.\n\nAt the narrativeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core are eyewitness accounts of those who experienced the atomic explosions firsthandÃ¢â‚¬â€the Japanese civilians on the ground and the American flyers in the air. Thirty people are known to have fled Hiroshima for NagasakiÃ¢â‚¬â€where they arrived just in time to survive the second bomb. One of them, Tsutomu Yamaguchi, is the only person who experienced the full effects of the cataclysm at ground zero both times. The second time, the blast effects were diverted around the stairwell in which Yamaguchi had been standing, placing him and a few others in a shock coccoon that offered protection, while the entire building disappeared around them.\n\nPellegrino weaves spellbinding stories together within an illustrated narrative that challenges the Ã¢â‚¬Å“official report,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ showing exactly what happened in Hiroshima and NagasakiÃ¢â‚¬â€and why.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nUsing a combination of firsthand accounts of Japanese A-bomb survivors, American aviators, and classified documents of government officials, Pellegrino (The Jesus Family Tomb) reconstructs two horrifying days and their aftermath when the age of atomic warfare was introduced over Japan. He is fascinated with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“strange alchemyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of these cruel weapons (Ã¢â‚¬Å“One ten-millionth of a second later, a sphere of gamma rays escap[ed] the core at light speedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) as the bomb fell on Mrs. Aoyam tending her garden at Point Zero, literally before she could see it coming. Pellegrino is equally interested in the grotesque effects the blasts in Hiroshima and Nagasaki inflicted on the human body with its gamma rays, neutron spray and poisonous black rain. The stories of the few Japanese survivors includes a group of 30 civilians fleeing from Hiroshima to Nagasaki where they arrived to endure the second bomb, are heart-stopping. Pellegrino dissects the complex political and military strategies that went into the atomic detonations and the untold suffering heaped on countless Japanese civilians, weaving all of the book's many elements into a wise, informed protest against any further use of these terrible weapons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d3ca7c33d5d067692ad50f45cd907c09498cb6","amp;dn":"Charles+Pellegrino+-+The+Last+Train+from+Hiroshima+%5B96%5D+Unabridg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d3ca7c33d5d067692ad50f45cd907c09498cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,211,202,124,51,213,208,103,105,42,213,15,69,205,144,124,9,73,140,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
