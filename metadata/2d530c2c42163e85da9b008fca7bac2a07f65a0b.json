Here's your lifeline! Biochemistry Demystified helps synthesize your understanding of this important topic.\n\nYou'll start with a review of basic chemical concepts and a look at cell structures and cell division. Next, you'll study carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, nucleotides, and enzymes. Glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and the control of chemical processes round out the coverage. Hundreds of examples and illustrations make it easy to understand the material, and end-of-chapter questions and a final exam help reinforce learning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d530c2c42163e85da9b008fca7bac2a07f65a0b","amp;dn":"Biochemistry+Demystified","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d530c2c42163e85da9b008fca7bac2a07f65a0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,83,12,44,66,22,62,133,218,155,0,143,202,123,172,42,7,246,90,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
