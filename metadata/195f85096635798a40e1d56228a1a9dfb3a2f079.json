Appropriately, it concentrates on the band's glory years of the late '60s and early '70s, when both Carlos Santana and his supporting musicians were on fire. There are several unreleased cuts, including live tracks included for hardcore fans, but Viva Santana! is most useful as a thorough overview for curious listeners. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nWith two discs to stretch out on, Viva Santana! offers a better and more varied career overview of the various Santana bands of the '60s, '70s, and '80s than the single-disc offerings Greatest Hits and The Best of Santana while stopping short of the fans-only appeal of the three-disc Dance of the Rainbow Serpent. All the great hits from the original sextet are included, such as &quot;Black Magic Woman,&quot; &quot;Evil Ways,&quot; &quot;Oye Como Va,&quot; and &quot;Soul Sacrifice.&quot; Later radio triumphs such as &quot;She's Not There,&quot; &quot;Dance Sister Dance,&quot; and &quot;Open Invitation&quot; are here, too, as are the dazzling instrumentals &quot;Incident at Neshabur&quot; and &quot;Europa (Earth's Cry, Heaven's Smile).&quot; Many of the cuts are live or previously unreleased, offering a treat for longtime fans and neophytes alike. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCD1\n01. &quot;Everybody's Everything&quot; (Live) \n02. &quot;Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen&quot; (1988 Remix)\n03. &quot;Guajira&quot; (1988 Remix) \n04. &quot;Jungle Strut&quot; (Live in Montreux, 1971) \n05. &quot;Ballin'&quot; (Previously Unreleased Studio Track 1967)\n06. &quot;Jingo&quot; (1988 Remix) \n07. &quot;Bambara&quot; (Previously Unreleased Zebop Outtake 1980) \n08. &quot;Angel Negro&quot; (Previously Unreleased Shango Rehearsal 1982)\n09. &quot;Incident At Neshabur&quot; (Live at the Fillmore West, 1971) \n10. &quot;Just Let the Music Speak&quot; (Previously Unreleased Freedom Outtake 1986) \n11. &quot;Super Boogie/Hong Kong Blues&quot; (Previously Unreleased Live 1985) \n12. &quot;Song Of The Wind&quot; (Live) \n13. &quot;Abi Cama&quot; (Live in Paris, April 1983) \n14. &quot;Vilato&quot; (Live in Paris, April 1983) \n15. &quot;Paris Finale&quot; (Live in Paris, April 1983) \n\nCD2\n01. &quot;Brotherhood&quot; (Live 1985) \n02. &quot;Open Invitation&quot; (Live in San Francisco 1985) \n03. &quot;Aqua Marine&quot; (Live) \n04. &quot;Dance Sister Dance (Baila Mi Hermana)&quot; (Live at California Jam II, Ontario, California 1978) \n05. &quot;Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)&quot; (Live in Japan 1979)\n06. &quot;Peraza I&quot; (Previously Unreleased Rehearsal Jam 1985) \n07. &quot;She's Not There&quot; (Live 1985) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:21\n08. &quot;Bambele&quot; (Previously Unreleased Live at Winterland 1973) \n09. &quot;Evil Ways&quot; (Original Version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:54\n10. &quot;Peraza II&quot; (Previously Unreleased Rehearsal Jam 1985) \n11. &quot;Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Woman&quot; (Live in Montreal 1982) \n12. &quot;Oye Como Va&quot; (Live in Montreal 1982) \n13. &quot;Persuasion&quot; (Original Version)\n\n*1988 Columbia / CBS | C2K 44344\n\n\n\n\n\nSantana - Live At The Fillmore '68 (1997) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9861906/Santana_-_Live_At_The_Fillmore__68_(1997)_[2CD]_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9861906/Santana_-_Live_At_The_Fillmore__68_(1997)_[2CD]_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSantana - Lotus (1974) [3CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9875505/Santana_-_Lotus_(1974)_[3CD]_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9875505/Santana_-_Lotus_(1974)_[3CD]_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
