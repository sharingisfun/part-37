Targeted at server, desktop and embedded use, it is now the only professional-quality virtualization solution that is also Open Source Software. \n\nSome of the features of VirtualBox are: \n\n\nModularity. \n\nVirtualBox has an extremely modular design with well-defined internal programming interfaces and a client/server design. This makes it easy to control it from several interfaces at once: for example, you can start a virtual machine in a typical virtual machine GUI and then control that machine from the command line, or possibly remotely. VirtualBox also comes with a full Software Development Kit: even though it is Open Source Software, you don't have to hack the source to write a new interface for VirtualBox. \n\nVirtual machine descriptions in XML. \n\nThe configuration settings of virtual machines are stored entirely in XML and are independent of the local machines. Virtual machine definitions can therefore easily be ported to other computers. \n\nGuest Additions for Windows and Linux. \n\nVirtualBox has special software that can be installed inside Windows and Linux virtual machines to improve performance and make integration much more seamless. Among the features provided by these Guest Additions are mouse pointer integration and arbitrary screen solutions (e.g. by resizing the guest window). \n\nShared folders. \n\nLike many other virtualization solutions, for easy data exchange between hosts and guests, VirtualBox allows for declaring certain host directories as &quot;shared folders&quot;, which can then be accessed from within virtual machines. \n\nA number of extra features are available with the full VirtualBox release only: \n\n\nVirtual USB Controllers. \n\nVirtualBox implements a virtual USB controller and allows you to connect arbitrary USB devices to your virtual machines without having to install device specific drivers on the host. \n\nRemote Desktop Protocol. \n\nUnlike any other virtualization software, VirtualBox fully supports the standard Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). A virtual machine can act as an RDP server, allowing you to &quot;run&quot; the virtual machine remotely on some thin client that merely displays the RDP data. \n\nUSB over RDP. \n\nWith this unique feature, a virtual machine that acts as an RDP server can still access arbitrary USB devices that are connected on the RDP client. This way, a powerful server machine can virtualize a lot of thin clients that merely need to display RDP data and have USB devices plugged in.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nThis is a maintenance release.\nThe following items were ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed and/or added:\n\n\nHost and guest clipboard: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed a number of issues affecting hosts and guests running the X window system.\n\nGuest Additions: make sure the virtual mouse autodetection works on ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½rst reboot after installing the Additions on X.Org server 1.5 and later.\n\nGuest Additions: properly report process identity number of running services\n\nGuest Additions: clean up properly if the X Window server terminates\n\n\nLinux Additions: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed installation path for OpenGL libraries in some 64-bit guests (bug #3693)\n\n\nSolaris Additions: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed installation to work when X.Org is not installed on the guest\n\nSolaris Additions: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed a bug that could panic the guest when unmounting a busy shared folder\n\n\nWindows Additions: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed mouse pointer integration of some Windows guests (2.2.0 regression, bug #3734)\n\nWindows Additions: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed installation on Windows Server 2008 Core (bug #2628)\n\n\nVMM: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed out-of-memory conditions on Windows hosts (bug #3657)\n\nVMM: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed occasional hangs when attaching USB devices during VM startup (2.2.0 regression; bugs #3787)\n\nVMM: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed guru meditation related to memory management (software virtualization only)\n\n\nVirtual disks: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½x possible data corruption when writing to diff images, incorrect detection of redundant writes\n\n\nGUI: reworked network settings dialog\n\nGUI: properly show the detailed settings dialog of NAT networks (bug #3702)\n\nGUI: HostKey could not be changed (2.2.0 regression, bug #3689)\n\nGUI: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed memory textÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½eld size (Windows hosts only; bug #3679)\n\nGUI: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed crash when selecting a shared folder path (Windows hosts only; bugs #3694, #3751, #3756)\n\n\nVBoxManage modifyhd --compact: implemented again for VDI ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½les, and now supports relative paths (bug #2180, #2833)\n\nVBoxManage snapshot discard: made it work again (2.1.0 regression; bug #3714)\n\n\nNAT: on some Windows host, the guest didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t receive a DHCP lease (bug #3655)\n\nNAT: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed release assertion during poll() (bug #3667)\n\n\nShared Folders: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed incorrect permissions for Solaris guests\n\nShared Folders: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed wrong ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½le sizes with Solaris guests\n\n\nCBindings: ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½xed possible memory leak while releasing the IVirtualBox and ISession Objects\n\n\nWindows installer: fixed several install and uninstall issues (bugs #3659, #3686, #1730, #3711, #3373, #3382, #3701, #3685, #3710)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4d48c97467b3b57a3697e26964163a6b75f2f44","amp;dn":"Sun+xVM+VirtualBox+2.2.2+%2832-bit+%26+64-bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4d48c97467b3b57a3697e26964163a6b75f2f44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,212,140,151,70,123,59,87,163,105,126,38,150,65,99,166,183,95,47,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
