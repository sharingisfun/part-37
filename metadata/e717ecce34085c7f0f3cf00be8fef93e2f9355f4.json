Heritage of Kings breaks from the typical pattern that Settlers games have followed since they began: while the concept of the game remains, in essence, the same, a lot of the gameplay features have changed from those of The Settlers IV, and slightly resemble many of the gameplay aspects displayed in the game Cossacks: European Wars. Despite this, Heritage of Kings still maintains many of the characteristics of classic Settlers gameplay.\n\ncreate a thriving settlement, while amassing an army and defeating rival nations. There are now, however, an extraordinarily large amount of features that can be used in-game. Settlers fans will no doubt recall the scarcity of resources in the previous games; in Heritage of Kings, the introduction of refineries for the various resources was a welcome addition, as it enabled players to construct more buildings in less time. Another welcome change was the addition of upgrading buildings: this enabled buildings to perform their specific job more efficiently, as well as providing room for more settlers to work there and, in some cases, providing new technology.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                END OF DESCRIPTION\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE DONT COMPLAIN AS IM 13 AND HAVE NO MONEY AND IM NOT LIEING,\n\nIf you want to donate for more torrents send paypal donations to:\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;07706e6b637068756b6334354766686b2964686a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e717ecce34085c7f0f3cf00be8fef93e2f9355f4","amp;dn":"The+Settlers+Heritage+Of+Kings+%5Bwillwills90%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e717ecce34085c7f0f3cf00be8fef93e2f9355f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,23,236,206,52,8,92,127,15,60,240,11,232,254,249,62,47,147,85,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
