With its power, he could do anything he wante--like get back at bully Woody Mingo. But as soon as he begins wearing the coin around his neck, strange things start to happen. Mysterious letters arrive in the dead of night. A strange, shadowy figure seems to be tracking him. And when Lewis finally gets his revenge on Woody, he feels as if someone else is inside his body, urging him to go even further. Has Lewis awakened a force beyond his control?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:052f1d75f38decb5143efdf259a0e3a3b4cb9963","amp;dn":"The+Figure+in+the+Shadows+-+John+Bellairs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"052f1d75f38decb5143efdf259a0e3a3b4cb9963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,47,29,117,243,141,236,181,20,62,253,242,89,160,227,163,180,203,153,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
