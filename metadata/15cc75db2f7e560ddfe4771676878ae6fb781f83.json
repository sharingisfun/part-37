Sometimes, I wish it wasn't. Regardless, in many ways I still can't believe it actually happened. After all, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d graduated from a prestigious university, was reared in an affluent home and knew that drugs were for losers. In fact, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not even sure when the metamorphosis occurredÃ¢â‚¬â€when I made the official leap from struggling musician to struggling junkyÃ¢â‚¬â€but it was definitely before I first stuck myself with a needle and began selling liquor camouflaged in fruit juice to underage children of the rich and famous. Of course, that was merely the tip of the illicit iceberg as so much remains hidden in that shadowy world where dope dealers pose as sales associates in drug fronts disguised as clothing boutiques, and chemically dependent cabbies provide shuttle services to junkies on a quest for the perfect fix. But certainly, the veil of deception would eventually be torn away when I was banished to that awful place, that asylum for the wretched, where another horrific decision would seal my fate with the watery wreckage of an international tragedy.\n\n***Profits from NEEDLE will be used to eliminate animal cruelty and improve the lives of homeless pets.\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile size:  epub 510 KB, mobi 641 KB\n\n\n\n\nTitle 2:\n\nNEEDLE TOO: Junkies in Paradise (Volume 2)\n\n\nDescription:\n\nRecovery. As far as heroin addiction is concerned, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure there really is such a thing. And of course, I never intended to write a sequel, but after NEEDLE was published it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t long before I realized a number of readers, many of them addicts or family members and friends of addicts, were eager to learn how I recovered from a decade of opiate abuse. But again, regardless of what the Ã¢â‚¬Å“expertsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ say, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure there is such a thingÃ¢â‚¬â€at least beyond what is often a precarious state of abstentionÃ¢â‚¬â€because Ã¢â‚¬Å“recoveryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ implies something different, or at least something more complete and comprehensive than the reality of the situation should suggest. Indeed, it implies the Ã¢â‚¬Å“recapturing of something that was lost, or the process by which one attempts to do so.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ However, regardless of my own opinion, my own non-medical industry opinion, although I had cast a few lines out to gage reader interest, I never truly expected to write another NEEDLE-related account of my life. But ironically, ANY account of my life post-NEEDLE would inherently have to address my addiction because regardless of my continued state of abstentionÃ¢â‚¬â€IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m constantly reminded of it: an old friend, fallout from the past, a song, a famous overdose, a suddenly gentrified street and of course, my long-lost innocence has a haunting potential and so...IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure there is such a thing. In any event, spurred on by my activist efforts and my readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ interest, while in the midst of fostering a 15 year-old Himalayan cat that was rescued from an empty apartment where it was holed-up in a bird cage for three years and was now ready to rip my face off (perhaps as some sort of Karmic comeuppance for failing felines in the past), I decided to give it my best effort. After all, at the very least it might shed some insights for addicts and provide additional help for the homeless animals which, of course, is my new addictionÃ¢â‚¬â€though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s far more distressing and disturbing than the old one was. It is, in fact, the same part of my life which, prior to writing NEEDLE TOO, I briefly discussed and published at www.Needleuser.com back in 2012, and though IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m loath to regurgitate materialÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it was just a few pages shared with a very small percentage of readersÃ¢â‚¬â€it was too important to do without in the most recent context because it detailed an event that was pivotal in how I got to where I am. And though I still question the realistic possibility of a complete recovery, after almost twenty years I'm still somehow here to tell the tale. So here it isÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and thanks for being a Needle user.\n\nProduct Details:\nFile size: epub 325 KB, mobi 457 Kb\n\n\nNote: Have tested chapter links using Calibre and Kindle on a desktop PC.\nEnjoy, and if you can, please purchase a copy of this ebook/book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15cc75db2f7e560ddfe4771676878ae6fb781f83","amp;dn":"Needle+%26amp%3B+Needle+Too+by+Craig+Goodman+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15cc75db2f7e560ddfe4771676878ae6fb781f83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,204,117,219,47,126,86,13,223,228,119,22,118,135,138,230,251,120,31,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
