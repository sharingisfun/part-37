He fell early under the influence of country blues, and then moved on to classic modern singer/songwriters like Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, and John Prine, as well as folk-based rockers like Tom Petty and Neil Young, honing his songwriting skills and developing a style that melded all of his influences, but was still uniquely his. Gomez released a debut album, the Jeff Trott-produced Rule the World, on New West Records early in 2013.\n\n  Album Review:\n\n  The first thing that hits one while listening to Max Gomez's debut album Rule the World is his voice, which sounds much older than a 23-year-old's, which is how old Gomez was upon the album's release. Sounding calm, unassuming, weary, and wise, he sings with the kind of balance and unhurried phrasing of a Townes Van Zandt, say, and his songs, which at first seem like fairly ordinary singer/songwriter fare, have a dark edge to them at times, and a natural grace and flow that are rare at any age. Although there is some stylistic and instrumental variety in this playlist, from the swampy blues feel of &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; to the folky &quot;What It Means&quot; and the pop-like &quot;Love Will Find a Way,&quot; Gomez's voice and singing don't really vary that much from track to track, which is a minor problem, although the songs have a sturdy and world-weary grace that makes them the real stars in this setting, and good songs will always find a voice. This is a promising debut.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cebf22d3e7f7ceda91a911764e8679cb3943fa3","amp;dn":"Max+Gomez+-+Rule+the+World+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cebf22d3e7f7ceda91a911764e8679cb3943fa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,235,242,45,62,127,124,237,169,26,145,23,100,232,103,156,179,148,63,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
