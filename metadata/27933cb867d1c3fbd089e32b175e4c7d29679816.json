Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27933cb867d1c3fbd089e32b175e4c7d29679816","amp;dn":"IHaveAWife+Ava+Addams+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27933cb867d1c3fbd089e32b175e4c7d29679816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,147,60,184,103,209,195,251,208,137,227,43,23,94,76,125,41,103,152,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
