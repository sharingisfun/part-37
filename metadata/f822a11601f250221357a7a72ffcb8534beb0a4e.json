Dying before his father, Edward III, he left his young son, the future Richard II, to an uncertain destiny. Despite his untimely death, the Black Prince played an integral role in English, Welsh, Spanish and French political life in the middle years of the fourteenth century. This was a period of intense political, social, economic and religious change, witnessing the outbreak of the Hundred Years War, the impact of repeated outbreaks of the Black Death, the notable growth of parliament's importance and EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first major heresy. The consequences of such events were extremely significant and wide-ranging and contributed to the transition from the medieval to the early modern world.\n\nThe Black Prince was right at the centre of such transitions. His life and career both influenced change and was representative of its effects. He serves therefore as a crucial figure in his own right and as an example that can be used to illuminate the forces at work in the middle and later years of the fourteenth century. This book both provides a biography of the prince and insight into the medieval world at large.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f822a11601f250221357a7a72ffcb8534beb0a4e","amp;dn":"The+Black+Prince+-+David+Green+%282001+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f822a11601f250221357a7a72ffcb8534beb0a4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,34,161,22,1,242,80,34,19,87,167,167,47,252,184,83,75,235,10,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
