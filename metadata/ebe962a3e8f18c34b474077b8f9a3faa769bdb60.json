The book will make a marvelous addition to your collection: a must-have for railfans, but also for anyone with fond memories of the postwar streamliners or interested in the history of passenger trains. The authors, Bruce MacGregor and Ted Benson are a great storyteller-photographer team, supported by other distinguished railfans such as Richard Steinheimer. The book was published in 1977, six years before Amtrak fortunately revived the California Zephyr on its original route as far west as Winnemucca, Nevada","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe962a3e8f18c34b474077b8f9a3faa769bdb60","amp;dn":"Portrait+of+a+Silver+Lady-The+Train+They+Called+the+California","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe962a3e8f18c34b474077b8f9a3faa769bdb60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,233,98,163,232,241,140,52,180,116,7,123,143,154,63,170,118,155,219,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
