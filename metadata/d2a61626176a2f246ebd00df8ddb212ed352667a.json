All you recognize is when\nit came back to the source and can be aware of the discourse.\n\nWith Fluctuation meditation, the background music is specifically\nselected to be beautiful and conductive to you remaining with it.\nThe chance of you staying with discourses is much higher.\nYour mind becomes occupied with the beauty of music if it wonders\naway from the discourse, and so it becomes much easier to become\naware of how your mind wonders away from the present moment.\n\nYou can create these meditations by yourself by playing the discourse\nusing one media player, such as VLC player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)\nor some other player and playing a song list with beautiful music.\nOsho musicians produced an outstanding collection of meditative music.\nSo, this would be a very good choice. But you can also play the ethnic\nmusic that you like. It works fine. But do not play any aggressive\nor complicated music such as rock or jazz. That won't work.\n\nThe music level should be set much quieter than the discourse\nand it should be overshadowed when voice gets loud. The only purpose\nof music is to provide you an additional hook to this very moment,\nso when mind wonders away on its trips, the first choice it is going\nto have is that beautiful music.\n\nFinally, you can search on anything you want out of Osho books\non line from :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://oshosearch.net/Convert/search.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://oshosearch.net/Convert/search.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor view the entire collection at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://oshosearch.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://oshosearch.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2a61626176a2f246ebd00df8ddb212ed352667a","amp;dn":"Osho+Fluctuation+Meditation+01+-+Be+Still+And+Know","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2a61626176a2f246ebd00df8ddb212ed352667a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,166,22,38,23,106,47,36,110,189,0,223,141,219,33,46,211,82,102,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
