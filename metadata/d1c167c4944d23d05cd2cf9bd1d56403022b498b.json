But before they do an autopsy on the GOP, they have to kill it, of course. Conservative media is angry at the Republican power players for not supporting Ken Cuccinelli. Guys, the problem is that Ken Cuccinelli wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t supported by votersÃ¢â‚¬â€theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the ultimate power players.\n\nIn the eyes of the far right conservative media, there were several serious defeats for the Republicans yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â€and in their eyes, the worst of them was the victory of Chris Christie. Conservative media have turned on Chris Christie in an attempt to devour him. That could take a while, and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean that as only a fat joke. Sean Hannity doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand all the fuss over Chris Christie. But then to be fair, Sean Hannity doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand anything. Ever. Hannity said he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand Ã¢â‚¬Å“what the big appeal of ChristieÃ¢â‚¬â€based on the recordÃ¢â‚¬â€is.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ HannityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right on this one, but this just proves the old adage about a stopped clock being right twice a day.\n\nWhile Chris Christie has been racking up victories, Rand Paul has been cracking up. Rand PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reaction to the plagiarism charges was probably even worse than the plagiarism itself... but at least is was original. Rand said Ã¢â‚¬Å“People can think what they want. I can go back to being a doctor anytime if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re tired of me. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll go back to being a doctor and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be perfectly content.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sure, as long as nobody asks for a second opinionÃ¢â‚¬â€because then you would evidently have a complete meltdown. After complaining that he was being sent to detention, Rand asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do I have to be in detention for the rest of my career?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry, RandÃ¢â‚¬â€maybe the rest of your career wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be that long at all.\n\nFinally, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good economic news, or as Republicans call it, bad political news. The US economy grew at a rate of 2.8 last quarter, which was better than economists expected and much better than Republicans wanted. The report was originally supposed to come out on October 30th, but was delayed by the government shutdown. Republican policies not only slow down the economy itself, they even slow down economic reporting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1c167c4944d23d05cd2cf9bd1d56403022b498b","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+07+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1c167c4944d23d05cd2cf9bd1d56403022b498b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,193,103,196,148,77,35,208,92,210,207,155,209,213,100,3,2,43,73,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
