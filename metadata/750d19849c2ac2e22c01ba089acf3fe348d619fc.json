Recorded both pre and post-maternity, Something About Knowing bristles with equal parts anticipation and bliss, with the former hanging over the hymn-like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Broken ObjectsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ like an overcast sky in mid-May, and the latter illuminating the amiable, quietly propulsive opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Folk Song MelodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ like a late afternoon, post-storm sunbeam, with both sentiments reaching consensus on the bouncy, unapologetically hopeful title track. Working again with producer/multi-instrumentalist Mike Mogis, who was an essential part of her well-received first two solo outings, 2005Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s 11:11 and 2007Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Lynn Teeter Flower, Something About Knowing retains many of the hazy dream pop undertones that informed her earlier work, while introducing a more streamlined, radio-ready patina that imbues standout cuts like the sweet-tempered closer Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lullaby for You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the dreamy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Saturday in June,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the bluesy, barroom floor stomper Ã¢â‚¬Å“Up All Night,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the latter a giddy rave-up that fuses the breezy melodiousness of RIlo Kiley onto a fiery, Ã¢â‚¬Å“RevolutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-era Beatles-inspired foundation, with a warm and winning current of urban Americana and evocative, two-lane-highway country-pop.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/s5hvPgs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/s5hvPgs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:750d19849c2ac2e22c01ba089acf3fe348d619fc","amp;dn":"Maria+Taylor+-+Something+About+Knowing+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"750d19849c2ac2e22c01ba089acf3fe348d619fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,13,25,132,156,42,194,226,44,1,186,8,154,207,63,227,72,214,25,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
