Now, with the same intensity and dramatic sweep that has brought this epic to life, Elliott returns to the exquisitely crafted cities and landscapes of the Hundred, in a thunderous conclusion to the saga.\n\nIn the darkness of war and destruction, forces gather to reclaim the peace: Those immortal Guardians who still serve justice seek a means to end the devastating reign of one of their own; a hired outlander army struggles to halt the advance of the horde that has despoiled vast lands and slaughtered countless people in its murderous wake, while still guarding against a burgeoning threat from an aggressively expansionist empire; and the eagle reeves who have long been the only law enforcers of the Hundred struggle to reorganize after a devastating massacre has decimated their numbers. But even as these forces give hope to those who would live in peace, a terrible danger looms: a traitor with Imperial ambitions, the most dreaded, least anticipated threat of allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nIn the unfolding drama of political upheaval and violent change, nothing is certain, as alliances dissolve and power shifts with the unpredictability of a desert sandstorm. A riotous epic with the vast breadth and excitement only masterful storyteller Kate Elliott can summon, TraitorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Gate will leave her many readers begging for more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52a8a98b19bbd42d90cd3339de3342c7aef33250","amp;dn":"Kate+Elliott-Traitors%5C%27+Gate-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52a8a98b19bbd42d90cd3339de3342c7aef33250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,168,169,139,25,187,212,45,144,205,51,57,222,51,66,199,174,243,50,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
