Which is no surprise, considering that guitarist Frank Potenza is a protege of the late, great jazz player. This new album has an evocatively retro, early 60s feel, enhanced by the arrangements and the ensemble behind Potenza: Joe Bagg on Hammond organ, Steve Barnes on drums and Holly Hoffmann guesting on flute on several cuts. Most of the tracks here blend warm introspection with a carefree, smoky late-night vibe. \n\n---------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c46a2cc21f0003b87a9952be480a6ddd13b5f3","amp;dn":"Frank+Potenza+Trio+-+Old%2C+New%2C+Borrowed+and+Blue+-+Jazz+Guitar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c46a2cc21f0003b87a9952be480a6ddd13b5f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,196,106,44,194,31,0,3,184,122,153,82,190,72,10,109,221,19,181,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
