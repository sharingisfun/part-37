Subsequent &quot;surgery&quot; demeans the greatness somehow. In my defense; the \n\n(2) CD VJC set would not rip cleanly.  I'll reburn them onto fresh media and\n\nupload both discs at a later date if I get enough positive feedback.  Meanwhile,\n\nlovers of Ellington can savor these &quot;Blanton-Webster era&quot; recordings from\n\nnearly 75 years ago or seek their own copies of both 80 minute discs.....fA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;For decades, the Fargo recordings, preserved on 16&quot; aluminum discs coated with\n\nacetate, were known only to Mr. Towers' friends and a few jazz insiders.  Some\n\nbootleg versions were released. \n\n\nWhen the recording finally came to light and was commercially released nearly\n\n40 years later, it was considered a musical and engineering miracle........\n\n\nThe revelatory recording, &quot;Duke Ellington at Fargo, 1940 live,&quot; won a Grammy\n\nAward in 1980 for best big-band album and established Mr. Towers' reputation\n\nas one of the foremost restorers of musical recordings in the country.&quot; (US)\n\n\nMatt Schudel (paraphrased)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c46fa2ad7e23079aff50a2eb9642d7e652ef064","amp;dn":"Duke+Ellington+%2F+FARGO+1940++%28abridged%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c46fa2ad7e23079aff50a2eb9642d7e652ef064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,70,250,42,215,226,48,121,175,245,10,46,185,100,45,126,101,46,240,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
