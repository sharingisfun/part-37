The result was Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, released in 1989 and supported \nby a successful tour. Because of the separate existence of Yes (part of the band's name still \nbeing owned by Chris Squire), this alternate incarnation were forced to use their surnames as \nthe band's name after Squire threatened legal action. Meanwhile, Yes began composing and \nrecording material for their follow-up, while Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe did the same\nbeginning production at Miraval Studios in the South of France in April 1990.\n\n\n   1.
