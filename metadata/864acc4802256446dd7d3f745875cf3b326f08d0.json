Turner (1775-1851). Profoundly affected by the death of his father, loved by a housekeeper he takes for granted and occasionally exploits sexually, he forms a close relationship with a seaside landlady with whom he eventually lives incognito in Chelsea, where he dies. Throughout this, he travels, paints, stays with the country aristocracy, visits brothels, is a popular if anarchic member of the Royal Academy of Arts, has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm, and is both celebrated and reviled by the public and by royalty. \n\nRatings: 7.0/10 from 7,477 users  \n\nDirector: Mike Leigh\n\nStars: Timothy Spall, Paul Jesson, Dorothy Atkinson\n\nGenre: Biography, Drama, History\n\nVideo: MPEG-4 x264 @ 901Kbps | Aspect: 1280 x 528 @ 23.976fps\n\nAudio: AAC 128Kbps 2ch | Language: English\n\nLength: 2h 30min | Size: 1080Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:864acc4802256446dd7d3f745875cf3b326f08d0","amp;dn":"Mr+Turner+%282014%29+BRRip+720p+-+MrKickASS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"864acc4802256446dd7d3f745875cf3b326f08d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,74,204,72,2,37,100,70,221,125,63,116,88,117,207,59,50,111,8,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
