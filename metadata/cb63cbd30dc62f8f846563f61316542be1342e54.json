It stars Shirley MacLaine and features John McMartin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Ricardo Montalban, Chita Rivera, Paula Kelly and Stubby Kaye. It is based on the 1966 stage musical of the same name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which Fosse had also directed and choreographed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which in turn is based on Federico Fellini, Ennio Flaiano and Tullio Pinelli's screenplay for Fellini's film Le Notti di Cabiria (Nights of Cabiria). However, where Fellini's black-and-white film concerns the romantic ups-and-downs of an ever-hopeful prostitute, the musical makes the central character a dancer-for-hire at a Times Square dance-hall.\n\nTrack listing\n 1.
