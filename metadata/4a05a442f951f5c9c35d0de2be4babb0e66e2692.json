The owner of a remarkable four-and-a-half-octave vocal range, he employed idiosyncratic rhythms, absurdist lyrics, and an unholy alliance of free jazz, Delta blues, latter-day classical music, and rock &amp; roll to create a singular body of work virtually unrivaled in its daring and fluid creativity. While he never came even remotely close to mainstream success, Beefheart's impact was incalculable, and his fingerprints were all over punk, new wave, and post-rock. \n\nFrank's half of this disc has six rare sides that he had a hand in for the Del-Fi label during the early '60s. These crude but adventurous productions clearly point toward The Mothers with their skilled R&amp;B and doo-wop chops that walk the line between affection and parody, and inventive montage of sound effects on the bizarre Dracula novelty single &quot;Dear Jeepers&quot;/&quot;Letter From Jeepers.&quot;\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tPop Almanac/Disky\nCatalog:\t\tPACD 7009\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.18% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Beatle Bones &amp; Smokin' Stones (Pt. 1) - Captain Beefheart\n02.Beatle Bones &amp; Smokin' Stones (Pt. 2) - Captain Beefheart\n03.Trust Us (Take 9) - Captain Beefheart\n04.Gimme That Harp Boy - Captain Beefheart\n05.Moody Liz (Take 8) - Captain Beefheart\n06.How's Your Bird - Frank Zappa\n07.The World's Greatest Sinner - Frank Zappa\n08.Everytime I See You - Frank Zappa\n09.Dear Jeepers - Frank Zappa\n10.Letter From Jeepers - Frank Zappa\n11.Cradle Rock - Frank Zappa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a05a442f951f5c9c35d0de2be4babb0e66e2692","amp;dn":"Beefheart+%2FZappa+-+Rare+Beefheart%2FVintage+Zappa+%281991%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a05a442f951f5c9c35d0de2be4babb0e66e2692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,5,164,66,249,81,245,201,195,93,13,226,190,75,171,176,230,110,38,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
