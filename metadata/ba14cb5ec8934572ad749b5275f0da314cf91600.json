The mystery deepens when the friend is found dead in an underground bunkerâ€¦apparently murdered the night before he appeared at Jacob's house. Jacob is arrested for the murder and put on trial.\r\n\r\nAs the details of the crime slowly come to light, the weave of reality becomes ever more tangled, twisted by a miraculous new technology and a quantum creature unconstrained by the normal limits of space and matter. With the help of his daughter, Alessandra, Jacob must find the true murderer before the creature destroys his family and everything he loves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba14cb5ec8934572ad749b5275f0da314cf91600","amp;dn":"David+Walton+-+Superposition+%28Superposition+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba14cb5ec8934572ad749b5275f0da314cf91600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,20,203,94,200,147,69,114,173,116,155,82,117,240,218,49,76,249,22,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
