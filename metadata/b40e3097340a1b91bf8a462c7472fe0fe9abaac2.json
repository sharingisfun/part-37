Molly the Mummy is an exquisitely drawn book that is enjoyable for kids age 2 to 102 featuring the always entertaining Molly. Molly is an unbelievably adorable six year old whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two main passions in life are playing with dolls and watching her favorite television show SparklinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Kitty. By the way, Molly is also a mummy. While that may be an important detail to know for the reader, to Molly it is no big deal. Most of the time Molly is completely oblivious to the fact she is a mummy. She just sees herself as a typical little girl. Molly and her father were awakened from their mummified sleep a few years prior to when our story takes place. At that time their mummified bodies were being displayed at The Natural History Museum of Cleveland.  The details of their reawakening are still somewhat murky. Regardless, once back on their feet, Molly and her father decided to make a go of it in Cleveland. MollyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dad even got a job as a mailman. MollyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dad does a good job of shielding Molly from others who may see her as a freak, a monster, or even a threat. He worries that he is sheltering her from the real world but feels it is for the best. Alas, MollyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sweet little world is soon to be completely turned over. Today is her first day of school and MollyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classmates may see a different Molly then the one she sees in herself. Good luck Molly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b40e3097340a1b91bf8a462c7472fe0fe9abaac2","amp;dn":"Molly_THE_Mummy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b40e3097340a1b91bf8a462c7472fe0fe9abaac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,14,48,151,52,10,27,145,191,138,70,44,116,114,254,15,233,171,170,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
