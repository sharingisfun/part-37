No longer are canyons 38m wide. Now you can experience the excitement of flying through canyons and valleys as close as 4.75m between walls. It makes for great low-level helicopter flying and for exploring unique geological formations that only 4.75m terrain can provide.\n\nUnlike other mesh products, the NEXTMap ProMesh series is based on highly accurate and reliable elevation data, as opposed to the USGS 10m NED data, some of which is based on 60-year old land surveys. \n\nFS Dreamscapes were the first designers to implement fractional elevation data settings, modeling all elevation changes to 1/25th of a meter vertically. \n\nThe end result is terrain accurately reflecting subtle differences in elevation changes that allow pilots to fly in a virtual real-world enrironment, as close to reality as possible.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf2d590bb40945c641a89aede767ca10f8b8943f","amp;dn":"FSX+FS+Dreamscapes+NextMap+ProMesh+California","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf2d590bb40945c641a89aede767ca10f8b8943f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,45,89,11,180,9,69,198,65,168,154,237,231,103,202,16,248,184,148,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
