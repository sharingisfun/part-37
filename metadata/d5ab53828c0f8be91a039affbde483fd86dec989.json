It was recorded at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea Music Centre, London, with production by Roy Thomas Baker (as Roy Baker), John Anthony and Queen.\n\nThe album was influenced by the seaside rock, hard rock, and heavy metal of the day and covers subjects such as folklore (&quot;My Fairy King&quot;) and religion (&quot;Jesus&quot;). Lead singer Freddie Mercury composed five of the ten tracks, guitarist Brian May composed four songs, including &quot;Doing All Right&quot;, which was co-written by Smile band-mate Tim Staffell and drummer Roger Taylor composed and sang &quot;Modern Times Rock and Roll&quot;. The final song on the album is a short instrumental version of &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;. The band included the comment 'No synthesisers' on the album sleeve, as some listeners had mistaken their elaborate multi-tracking and effects processed by guitar and vocal sounds as synthesisers. Bassist John Deacon was credited on the sleeve notes of the original vinyl release as &quot;Deacon John&quot;, as Mercury and Taylor thought this may make him sound more interesting.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;   \tBrian May \t3:46\n02. \t&quot;Doing All Right&quot;   \tMay, Tim Staffell \t4:10\n03. \t&quot;Great King Rat&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury \t5:41\n04. \t&quot;My Fairy King&quot;   \tMercury \t4:07\n05. \t&quot;Liar&quot;   \tMercury \t6:26\n06. \t&quot;The Night Comes Down&quot;   \tMay \t4:24\n07. \t&quot;Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t1:48\n08. \t&quot;Son and Daughter&quot;   \tMay \t3:19\n09. \t&quot;Jesus&quot;   \tMercury \t3:45\n10. \t&quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; (Instrumental) \tMercury \t1:10\n\n2011 Universal Records reissue bonus disc\n\n01. \t&quot;Keep Yourself Alive (De Lane Lea Demo, December 1971)&quot;   \t3:50\n02. \t&quot;The Night Comes Down (De Lane Lea Demo, December 1971)&quot;   \t4:22\n03. \t&quot;Great King Rat (De Lane Lea Demo, December 1971)&quot;   \t6:07\n04. \t&quot;Jesus (De Lane Lea Demo, December 1971)&quot;   \t5:04\n05. \t&quot;Liar (De Lane Lea Demo, December 1971)&quot;   \t7:52\n06. \t&quot;Mad the Swine (June 1972)&quot;   \t3:22","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5ab53828c0f8be91a039affbde483fd86dec989","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Queen+%5Bwith+BONUS+EP%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5ab53828c0f8be91a039affbde483fd86dec989","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,171,83,130,140,15,139,233,26,3,154,255,189,228,131,253,134,222,201,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
