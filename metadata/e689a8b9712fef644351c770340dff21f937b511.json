With an accessible and lively writing style, it introduces modern techniques to what can often be a formal and intimidating subject. Readers are led from the physics of flat spacetime (special relativity), through the intricacies of differential geometry and Einstein's equations, and on to exciting applications such as black holes, gravitational radiation, and cosmology. For advanced undergraduates and graduate students, or anyone interested in astronomy, cosmology, physics, or general relativity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e689a8b9712fef644351c770340dff21f937b511","amp;dn":"Spacetime+and+Geometry++%5BSean+Carroll%5D+djvu+%7BCharm-Quark%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e689a8b9712fef644351c770340dff21f937b511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,137,168,185,113,47,239,100,67,81,199,112,52,13,255,33,249,55,181,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
