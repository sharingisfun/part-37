An exciting new industrial ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“eargasmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ set to attack the dancefloors. This Greek/Swiss project combines industrial beats with dark and eclectic samples from horror movies, gothic church choruses, orthodox Greek ceremonies and ancient celtic rituals. Industrial and menacing but also melodic and emotional. A unique new sound, song by song. Reaper was formed shortly before the dissolution of his NamNamBulu project and took on greater prominence following the split. The 'Angst EP' was released in July 2005. The project played a number of live shows prior to the release of the full length album 'Hell Starts With An H' in early 2007. The project toured Europe supporting Combichrist around this time. At the end of 2007, the EP 'The Devil Is Female' was released, reaching No.1 in the DAC.\n\n\n\n\nAngst EP (Infacted, 2005)\nJagd\nAngst\nDaemon\nTotengraeber (Club Edit)\nAngst (Soman Remix)\nTotengraeber (Original edit)\nDaemon (Gudfried Remix by Heimataerde)\nWeltfremd\nVerloren.\n\n\nHell Starts With An H CD (Infacted, 2007)\nIntro\nUrnensand\nDas Grauen\nTwisted Trophy Hunter - (with Mark Jackson of VNV Nation)\nAltum Silentium\nExecution of Your Mind\nWeltfremd - (with Suicide Commando/Johan Van Roy)\nRobuste Maschine\nMemento Mori\nTotengraber 07\nAncient Tragedy\nTth 2.0 - (with Nymph)\nUrnensand - (S.A.M. remix)\nExecution of Your Mind - (Modulate remix)\nUrnensand - (Damonie/Painbastard remix)\nTwisted Trophy Hunter - (remix)\nUrnensand - (Schallfaktor remix)\n\n\nThe Devil Is Female EP (Infacted, 2007)\nThe Devil Is Female\nX-Junkie\nShe Is a Devil and a Whore\nX-Junkie (Club Mix)\n0190\nX-Junkie (Shnarph Remix)\nX-Junkie (Grendel Remix)\nX-Junkie (Distatix Remix)\nX-Junkie (Syncrotek Remix)\nExecution of Your Mind (live)\nX-Junkie (Revolution by Night Remix)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bb2f31b8ef5186dea24969bd3ec261af0d50f9e","amp;dn":"Complete+Reaper+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bb2f31b8ef5186dea24969bd3ec261af0d50f9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,178,243,27,142,245,24,109,234,36,150,155,211,236,38,26,240,213,15,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
