Howard's cloaked pulp character. Deathwatch's Michael J. Bassett directs from his own script, with Max von Sydow, Pete Postlethwaite, Rachel Hurd-Wood, Alice Krige, and Mackenzie Crook co-starring. ~ Jeremy Wheeler.\n\nOnce a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth I fighting Spainards in Africa, He met the Devil's Reaper and discovered he was bound for hell! Barely escaping he soon renounced violence to atone for his past sins, seeking out redemption in a life of peace. That is until the followers of priest turned sorcerer Malachi kidnap a Purtian girl Meredith Crowthorn and brutally slaughter her family before his very own eyes (including butchering her beloved younger brother Edward who Solomon had befriended)! Forcing Solomon to take up arms and return to his violent ways once more to rescue her! In doing so means returning to his birthplace and facing his older brother Marcus who (in his youth) he accidentally left disfigured (and for dead), who now serves as merciless enforcer to Malachi.\n\nBasic Information:\nFilm Length: 1h:43m\nLanguage: English\nOriginal Source: Solomon.Kane.2009.1080p.BluRay.x264-LEVERAGE\n\nVideo Information:\nVideo Bitrate: 2072 Kbps XviD\nFramerate: 23.976fps\nDisplay aspect ratio: 0.124\nResolution: 1280x544\n\nAudio Information: \nAudio #1: 640kb/s 48000 Hz 6-channel AC3\n\nIsis NOTES\nPC, PS3 &amp; XBOX 360 COMPATIBLE\n\ncredit IsisGoddess BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08f88114e76ce8cf3dd8b9c2a42a4412eddf927a","amp;dn":"Solomon+Kane%282009%29720p+BRRip+XviD%5BResourceRG+by+Isis%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08f88114e76ce8cf3dd8b9c2a42a4412eddf927a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,248,129,20,231,108,232,207,61,216,185,194,164,42,68,18,237,223,146,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
