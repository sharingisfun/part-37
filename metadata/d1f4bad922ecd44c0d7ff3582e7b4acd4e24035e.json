It also published a small line of comic books and other magazines. This pack contains all currently scanned issues of their publications.\n\nThe company name is a combination of those of its founders, former Marvel Comics production manager Sol Brodsky (&quot;Sky&quot;) and low-budget entrepreneur Israel Waldman (&quot;wald&quot;). Skywald was based in New York City.\n\nThe horror magazines attempted a somewhat more literary bent than the twist-ending shockers of early Warren Publishing and sought to evoke the feel of such writers as Poe, H. P. Lovecraft and Kafka.\nComics professionals who produced work for the Skywald magazines include writers T. Casey Brennan, Gerry Conway, Steve Englehart, Gardner Fox, Doug Moench, Dave Sim, Len Wein, and Marv Wolfman, and artists Rich Buckler, Vince Colletta, Bill Everett, Bruce Jones, Pablo Marcos, Syd Shores, Chic Stone, and Tom Sutton. Many who also contributed to rival Warren employed pseudonyms.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f4bad922ecd44c0d7ff3582e7b4acd4e24035e","amp;dn":"Skywald+Comics+%28All+Scanned+Issues%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f4bad922ecd44c0d7ff3582e7b4acd4e24035e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,244,186,217,34,236,212,76,13,127,243,88,46,123,74,205,78,36,3,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
