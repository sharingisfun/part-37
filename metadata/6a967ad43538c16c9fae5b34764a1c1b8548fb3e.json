Initially             \n heartbroken, Bella finds a form of comfort in reckless living, as well as    \n an even-closer friendship with Jacob Black. Danger in different forms awaits. \n                                                                              \n\n--------==========----------\nHappy Hacker Industries \n\nIs an Audio/Video ripping group founded several years ago\nby a few individuals who do nothing but deal with computers\non a yearly 24/7 schedule; and sometimes when sleeping. \n\nWe release things as we find the time to do so, we do not \nrelease items necessarily as they come out in the stores.\nWe take pride in our releases and do monitor various outlets\nwhere our work can be acquired.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a967ad43538c16c9fae5b34764a1c1b8548fb3e","amp;dn":"Twilight.New+Moon.WS.2010.XviD.HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a967ad43538c16c9fae5b34764a1c1b8548fb3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,150,122,212,53,56,193,108,159,174,91,52,118,74,28,27,133,72,251,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
