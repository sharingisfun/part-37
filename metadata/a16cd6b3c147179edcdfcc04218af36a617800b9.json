Their videos turn people youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never heard of into brand name surfers. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in a Taylor Steele movie, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made it.\n\nStranger Than Fiction is essentially Campaign 3. With Campaign 2 being one of my all time favorite movies, this one does not disappoint.\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what you can expect from this, and any Taylor Steele movie.\n\nThe most progressive surfing youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen yet.\nThe sickest turns, gouges, airs, and barrels filmed by anyone this year.\nSurfers looking cool carrying multiple boards to the beach (if a surfer expects to leave the beach without a broken board, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about to be in a Taylor Steel movie).\nHeart racing, mtv generation video editing.\nMultiple epic sountracks.\nSurfers trying their hand at big screen acting (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hilarious).\nA wipeout section (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s epic, enough said).\nSurfers with sections: Andy Irons, Julian Wilson, Josh Kerr, Rizal Tanjung, Taj Burrow, Bruce Irons, Ian Walsh, Dean Morrison, Kalani Robb, Dion Agius, Mick Fanning, Dusty Payne, Mich Coleborn, Ry Craike, Benji Weatherley, Clay Marzo, Shane Dorian, Yadin Nicol, Rob Machado, Jordy Smith, Shaun Cansdell, Mike Losness, Joel Parkinson, CJ Hobgood, Dane Reynolds\n\nBest section: Without a doubt, Dane Reynolds. He holds the coveted final section, and it is more than deserved. Huge boosts, airs going beyond 360, multiple airs on the same wave.\n\nAndy Irons, Joel Parkinson, Jordy Smith, and Taj Burrow all have pretty sick sections too, but lets not kid ourselves here, everyone has a sick section.\n\nMore surfers: Jamie OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Brien, Bobby Martinez, Wade Goodall, Luke Stedman, Dino Adrian, Dede Suryana, Cheyne Magnusson, Brent Dorrington, Pepen Hendrix, Betet Mertha, Hank Gaskell, Craig Anderson, Marlon Gerber, Tonino Benson, Lee Wilson, Damien Hobgood\n\nEpic quotes:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This just in, Ry Craike wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go right.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“DNA testing revealed today that CJ and Damien Hobgood are actually the same person.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dion Agius: Professional bodyboarder, now thinks he can standup surf. Good luck with that Dion.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16cd6b3c147179edcdfcc04218af36a617800b9","amp;dn":"%5BSURF%5D+Stranger+than+Fiction.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16cd6b3c147179edcdfcc04218af36a617800b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,108,214,179,193,71,23,158,220,223,204,4,33,138,243,106,97,120,0,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
