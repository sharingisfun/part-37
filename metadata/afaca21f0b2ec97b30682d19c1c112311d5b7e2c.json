It begins with Warren A. â€œDadâ€ Bechtel, who led a consortium that constructed the Hoover Dam. From that auspicious start, the family and its eponymous company would go on to â€œbuild the world,â€ from the construction of airports in Hong Kong and Doha, to pipelines and tunnels in Alaska and Europe, to mining and energy operations around the globe.\r\n\r\nToday Bechtel is one of the largest privately held corporations in the world, enriched and empowered by a long history of government contracts and the privatization of public works, made possible by an unprecedented revolving door between its San Francisco headquarters and Washington. Bechtel executives John McCone, Caspar Weinberger, and George P. Shultz segued from leadership at the company to positions as Director of the CIA, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of State, respectively.\r\n\r\nLike all stories of empire building, the rise of Bechtel presents a complex and riveting narrative. In The Profiteers, Sally Denton, whom The New York Times called â€œa wonderful writer,â€ exposes Bechtelâ€™s secret world and one of the biggest business and political stories of our time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afaca21f0b2ec97b30682d19c1c112311d5b7e2c","amp;dn":"The+Profiteers%3A+Bechtel+and+the+Men+Who+Built+by+Sally+Denton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afaca21f0b2ec97b30682d19c1c112311d5b7e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,172,162,31,11,46,201,123,48,104,45,25,193,193,18,49,29,91,126,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
