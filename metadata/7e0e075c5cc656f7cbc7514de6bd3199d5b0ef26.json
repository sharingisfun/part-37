It tells a story about a young girl who disguises as a boy, Osama, that shows life under the Taliban, and was the first film to be shot entirely in that country since 1996, when the Taliban rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gime banned the creation of all films. The film was an international co-production between companies in Afghanistan, the Netherlands, Japan, Ireland and Iran.\n\nAlthough the title of the film highlights an allegorical relevance to Osama bin Laden, there is no further similarity\n\nCAST (non-professionals)\n Marina Golbarhari\n Khwaja Nader\n Arif Herati\n Zubaida Sahar\n Hamida Refah\n Gol Rahman Ghorbandi\n\nStory\nA 12-year-old Afghan girl (Marina Golbahari) and her mother (Zubaida Sahar) lose their jobs when the Taliban close the hospital where they work. The Taliban have also forbidden women to leave their houses without a male &quot;legal companion.&quot; With her husband and uncle dead, having been killed in battle during the Soviet invasion and their civil wars, there are no men left to support the family. Unable to leave the house without fear of arrest and torture, the mother is left with nowhere to turn. With no other choice, and inspired by a story her mother tells about a boy who went under a rainbow and became a girl, she disguises her daughter as a boy named 'Osama'. Osama manages to secure a job at the local chai tea shop, but 'his' effeminate ways quickly arouse suspicion among the other boys.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368913/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368913/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e0e075c5cc656f7cbc7514de6bd3199d5b0ef26","amp;dn":"Osama+%282003%29+-+story+about+a+young+girl+who+disguises+as+a+boy.a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e0e075c5cc656f7cbc7514de6bd3199d5b0ef26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,14,7,92,92,198,86,247,203,199,81,77,230,189,49,153,213,176,239,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
