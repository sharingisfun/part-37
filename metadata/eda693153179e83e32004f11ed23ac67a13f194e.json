It was Hitler that was \nexactly such a menace to the core - and he was cruel to our women\nin what befell them as a result in Germany too as a result of the defeat.\n\nNor is Germany ever going to be allowed to be defiled this way again \nas were the women of Berlin depicted in this terrible tale of a sad\nstate of criminality run-amok\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\n\nP.S. We are awaiting movies from Germany and Sweden that were held up due to the\nrecent postal shut-down in Canada - as work is slowly returning to normal here\nas I make this note. The edit feature here doesnt work for me so Ill clear this\ncomment belatedly - later when things are normal in this respect.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda693153179e83e32004f11ed23ac67a13f194e","amp;dn":"A+woman+in+Berlin+%282008%29+DivX+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+Nina+Hoss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda693153179e83e32004f11ed23ac67a13f194e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,166,147,21,49,121,232,62,50,0,79,17,237,35,172,103,161,63,25,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
