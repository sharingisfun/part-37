Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf10f721b03f454548ff6bdc38087d6145dcb2f","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23301+-+Doug+Stanhope+%5B64k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf10f721b03f454548ff6bdc38087d6145dcb2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,241,15,114,27,3,244,84,84,143,246,189,195,128,135,214,20,93,203,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
