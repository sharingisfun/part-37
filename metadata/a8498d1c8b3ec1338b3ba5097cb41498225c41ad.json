Well this is precisely the musical space created by electronic producer and performer Opiuo.\n \nOriginally from a small town deep in the New Zealand countryside, Opiuo now resides in the pimp hustle back streets of Melbourne Australia, where he has gone about building an international reputation for his extremely original, party fuelling creations. Playing live at major festivals, headlining club nights, and touring extensively in front of sold out crowds all across the North America and Australasia.\n \nFavouring fun n funk fuelled body shaking sonic manipulations, the Opiuo sound is being included in DJ sets from some of the worlds most respected, from Z-Trip to Bassnectar, KraftyKuts to Tipper and everyone in between. His music has featured in films, documentaries, television series, and high profile radio stations throughout the globe. 2010 even saw him selected to open for MC Hammer at a private Google party. Quite literally rocking ear holes in every corner of the globe.\n \nHis music has dominated digital download charts, with his debut full length release ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSlurp And GiggleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ being nominated for Best Dance / Electronic Release at the Australian Independent Music Awards, reaching number 10 on iTunes, and was the most downloaded album for 2010 on addictech.com. His releases as singles have spent time at #1 on breatport.com in the Breaks, Electronica, Dubstep, and even Chillout charts.\n\n\nEnjoy, LOUD! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8498d1c8b3ec1338b3ba5097cb41498225c41ad","amp;dn":"Opiou+-+6+Track+Collection+%5BElectronic+Glitch-Hop%5D+%5B320k+mp3%28CBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8498d1c8b3ec1338b3ba5097cb41498225c41ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,73,141,28,139,62,193,51,139,59,165,9,124,180,20,152,34,92,65,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
