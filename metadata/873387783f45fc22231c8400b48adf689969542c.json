Of course, being as this film was released in 1944, the killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s focus is altered slightly, taking out his frustrations on chorus girls as opposed to the more traditional Ã¢â‚¬Å“ladies of the eveningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a minor adjustment, and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deter one bit from what is ultimately a chilling look inside the mind of a psychopath.\n\nThe setting is London, during the height of the murders. Robert and Ellen Bonting (Cedric Hardwicke and Sara Allgood) have just rented a room in their spacious London flat to a strange man named Slade (Laird Cregar). From the moment he moves in, Slade behaves in a peculiar manner, like his penchant for taking long walks at night and bringing his black medical bag along with him. Putting the clues together, Mrs. Bonting begins to wonder if their new tenant is, in reality, the killer known as Jack the Ripper, who in recent months has butchered several young women. Augmenting her concern is the fact Slade has become infatuated with the BontingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s niece, Kitty (Merle Oberon), herself a showgirl. But is Slade really the dreaded Ripper, or simply an innocent man with a few bizarre idiosyncrasies?\n\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : The.Lodger.1944.DVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 151 Kbps\nLength            : 1.26 GiB for 1h 23mn 45s 62ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 950 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 540 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #3           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037024/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037024/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873387783f45fc22231c8400b48adf689969542c","amp;dn":"The.Lodger.1944.DVDRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873387783f45fc22231c8400b48adf689969542c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,51,135,120,63,69,252,34,35,28,132,0,180,138,223,104,153,105,84,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
