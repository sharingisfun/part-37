HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s caviar and champagne; sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take-out Chinese pot stickers. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an uptight Republican lawyer; she was raised in a commune. He wants to get ahead in business; she just wantsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦him. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no way Tess will play second fiddle to his job.\nYet somehow she finds herself agreeing to play his fiancÃƒÂ©e on a weekend business trip that could make or break NickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career. And while heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to convince Tess that he needs her in his respectable world, Tess is doing her best to keep her opinions to herself and her hands off Nick.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04249b9783017264a62d9b704e9a7ef519f167db","amp;dn":"Strange+Bedpersons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04249b9783017264a62d9b704e9a7ef519f167db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,36,155,151,131,1,114,100,166,45,155,112,78,154,126,245,25,241,103,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
