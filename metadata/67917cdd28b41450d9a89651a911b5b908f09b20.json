If that sounds cool to you (it does to me), then check out Demolition Saint. 7 out of 10\n\n1 - Beyond the Doors of Insanity (05:54)\n2 - Igranoce Is the Law (03:39)\n3 - God-Fearing (06:14)\n4 - Brainless World (06:26)\n\nEnjoy!\n\nGenre:\tThrash\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t51.15 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n5 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67917cdd28b41450d9a89651a911b5b908f09b20","amp;dn":"Demolition+Saint+-+Ignorance+Is+The+Law+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67917cdd28b41450d9a89651a911b5b908f09b20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,145,124,221,40,180,20,80,217,168,150,81,169,17,181,185,8,240,155,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
