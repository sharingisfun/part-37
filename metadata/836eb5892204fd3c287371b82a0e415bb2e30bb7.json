Dungeons await, each one deeper, each one more perilous and each one more challenging than the last.\nYou will meet monsters and you will need skill and tactics to defeat them. You will find weird and wonderful treasures along the way. Most will help you, but some might not. You may choose to play as a Crusader, a Witch or a Mercenary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in fact each one might well be required if you are to successfully complete your quest Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but knowing when to use each one is something you are going to have to figure out for yourself.\nThe reward for your endeavours?
