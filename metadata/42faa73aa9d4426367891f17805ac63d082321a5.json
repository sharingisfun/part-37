It has lots of Ã¢â‚¬Å“batteriesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ included, and makes it easy to\nget up and going. But all of the power means you can write low quality code that still seems to work. So what does\nEffective Django mean? It means using Django in a way that emphasizes writing code thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cohesive, testable, and\nscalable. What do each of those words mean?\nWell, Ã¢â‚¬Å“cohesiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ code is code that is focused on doing one thing, and one thing alone. It means that when you write a\nfunction or a method, that it does one thing and does it well.\nThis is directly related to writing testable code: code thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing too much is often difficult to write tests for. When I\nfind myself thinking, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well, this piece of code is just too complex to write a test for, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not really worth all the effort,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nthatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a signal that I need to step back and focus on simplifying it. Testable code is code that makes it straight-forward\nto write tests for, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to diagnose problems with.\nFinally, we want to write scalable code. That doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just mean it scales in terms of performance, but that it also\nscales in terms of your team and your teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understanding. Applications that are well tested are easier for others\nto understand (and easier for them to modify), which means youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re more able to improve your application by adding\nengineers.\nMy goal is to convince you of the importance of these principles, and provide examples of how to follow them to build\nmore robust Django applications. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to walk through building a contact management application iteratively,\ntalking about the choices and testing strategy as I go.\nThe sample code for this tutorial is available in the effective-django-tutorial (https://github.com/nyergler/effectivedjango-\ntutorial/) git repository.\nSlides for the tutorial are available at http://effectivedjango.com/slides/tutorial","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42faa73aa9d4426367891f17805ac63d082321a5","amp;dn":"Effectic+Django+Framework+OSCON+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42faa73aa9d4426367891f17805ac63d082321a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,250,167,58,169,212,66,99,103,137,31,23,128,90,198,61,8,35,33,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
