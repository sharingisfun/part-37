The latter, as the name point out, is only acessible to people that pay for it. Some people call it a scam other people vouch for it's efectivness. Personally I think it's a bit of both. The resources in tis zip file include their public website and their member website which I'm making available for free so that anyone can use it in their computers and have a try without paying 70$ for it.\n\nCalm_Clinic_and_Triad_Course.zip (NOT password protected)\nSize compressed: 672MB\nSize uncompressed: 766MB\nResources formats: WEB/HTML/MP4/MP3/PDF\n\n\n\nBellow is a brief summary:\n\n\n\n\nCalm Clinic for Your Anxiety &amp; Panic\n====================================\n\nMost people think of anxiety as a terrible enemy. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be. Anxiety is a normal part of life, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a vital part of your survival. You actually need some anxiety to perform efficiently. The problem isn't anxiety. The problem is when anxiety gets out of control ...\n\nThat's when you have an anxiety disorder. Diagnosis of an anxiety disorder means you have problems dealing with stress and pressure. You may be ashamed of it, but you really shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be: as many as 15% of the population suffers from anxiety.  Along with depression, anxiety disorders are the most common and widespread psychological conditions. There are more people than you imagine who can relate with your predicament.\n\n\n\nThe Triad Technique\n===================\n\nwww.CalmClinic.com and the Triad Technique started as more of an interesting project, based on my own experiences with anxiety. I wanted to provide a place where research and thoughtful responses could be given to those that needed better information about the symptoms of their anxiety disorder, because in my own experience understanding anxiety was an important part of remaining calm when the symptoms occurred.\n\nSo I created the Triad Technique and Calm Clinic, a website with a relaxing name that I felt would be a good place to share research based information on the symptoms and treatments of anxiety in a way that others with anxiety could easily understand.\n\nIt wasn't until later that I realized how quickly the site was growing. At first, I was just writing as much as I could with the time I had. Then over time, as I noticed how important this information was and how many more symptoms, treatments, drugs, and more there were to cover, I realized it was more important to build a larger site that others would use. I had to develop what I now call The Triad Technique to battle the anxiety scam.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6d5a6a619fe14f4f7a56fd7caab990f4ec9ab9","amp;dn":"Calm+Clinic+-+Triad+Technique+Course","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da6d5a6a619fe14f4f7a56fd7caab990f4ec9ab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,109,90,106,97,159,225,79,79,122,86,253,124,170,185,144,244,236,154,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
