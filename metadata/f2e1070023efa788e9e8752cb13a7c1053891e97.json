It includes recurring coverage of &quot;identity&quot; and how people make places and shape identities to see global, local and individual implications of decisions that people make every day.The main objective of this issue is to provide more understanding of human systems from a spatial perspective; ways to think globally; and ways to understand real-world implications of Human Geography.
