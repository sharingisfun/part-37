Case explains the fundamentals of delay and modulation effects and how to apply these effects, technically and creatively, to improve the sound of a mix. The course covers adjusting individual parameters such as delay time, level, and feedback; working with long delays to create echoes, enhance groove, and add support; using delay modulation for chorus and doubling effects; and dialing-in spectral effects from delay, such as flanging. This course also includes Get in the Mix (GITM) sessions for both Avid Pro Tools and Apple Logic Pro. Exercise files are also included with the course.\n\nTopics include:\nAdjusting the delay time, level, and feedback parameters\nUtilizing a low-pass filter and polarity reverse\nSetting up an effects loop\nSetting the delay time by tempo or by ear\nUnderstanding the distinct uses of short, medium, and long delays\nAdjusting modulation rate, depth, and shape\nAdding double tracking and spreader effects\nManipulating tone with constructive or destructive interference\nCreating a comb filter and flange effect","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6494b909bd0bfb221591b4adb7067928b93437d9","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Foundations+of+Audio%3A+Delay+and+Modulation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6494b909bd0bfb221591b4adb7067928b93437d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,148,185,9,189,11,251,34,21,145,180,173,183,6,121,40,185,52,55,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
