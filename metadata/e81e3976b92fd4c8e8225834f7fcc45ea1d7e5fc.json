While showing them the Nine-Tails chakra, Naruto detects ill-intent coming from Samehada, exposing Kisame, who tries to escape. Naruto hits him hard, but lacking fine control over the Nine-Tails' chakra, he twists his ankle. B gives chase while Yamato tends to Naruto. Guy, having learned about Naruto's training, goes to the Falls of Truth with Aoba and Motoi. Teased by Aoba, Guy begins seeing his true self, when Kisame leaps out of the waterfall, inside Samehada. Guy mistakes Kisame for his true self and attacks. B emerges from the waterfall. Kisame uses Samehada to steal B's chakra, and then also steals Aoba's when he tries paralysing him before fleeing. Guy opens the Eight Gates and B throws him in the direction Kisame went. Guy uses Ningame as a stepping stone to keep going. Kisame deposits a scroll with intel into a shark, and creates a thousand more when Guy arrives. Guy destroys several sharks, but many more remain. Guy opens the seventh gate and prepares a single blow attack. Kisame attacks with a special attack that is supposed to absorb chakra. Kisame is confused when his own attack doesn't get stronger despite Guy's getting smaller. Guy's attack hits Kisame.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e81e3976b92fd4c8e8225834f7fcc45ea1d7e5fc","amp;dn":"%5BM%40nI%5D+Naruto+Shippuden%2FShippuuden+250+720p+%28Dual+Audio%29+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e81e3976b92fd4c8e8225834f7fcc45ea1d7e5fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,30,57,118,185,47,212,200,232,34,88,52,247,252,196,94,161,215,229,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
