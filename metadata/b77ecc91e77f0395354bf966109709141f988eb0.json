Swirling synths that spin and spin until they fall down dizzy. Steady-galloping drums that coolly pass you by. These Midwestern boys have wrapped them all up into rip-your-heart out ballads about getting older but not necessarily happier Ã¢â‚¬â€œ songs that capture the old joy of classic records and do-nothing days, and the ache of knowing they're mostly gone. Yes, there's a good kind of sadness, and this is what it sounds like.&quot;\n\n- Melissa Maerz, Rolling Stone Magazine\n\n\n&quot;Solomon also started work on new music under theCommunist Daughter moniker recorded at his home, which isn't a cabin. But it's in a small town, so that has to count for something. And while Solomon has cultivated the requisite indie-rock facial hair, he hasn't forgotten his power-pop roots, which means he's still kicking out some fierce tunes that sound great regardless of the amount of electricity used in performing them. If you were too late to score a Bon Iver ticket, do yourself a favor and head over to the Kitty Cat Klub on Saturday to catch Communist Daughter perform on a bill with Jenny Dalton and Patchwork. And if you're a musician, I guess you might want to start hunting for your own forgotten corner of Packerland to start recording the next budding masterpiece.&quot;\n\n- Ross Rahallia, St. Paul Pioneer Press","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77ecc91e77f0395354bf966109709141f988eb0","amp;dn":"Communist+Daughter+-+Soundtrack+to+the+End+%5B2010%5D+%5BAlbum%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77ecc91e77f0395354bf966109709141f988eb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,126,204,145,231,127,3,149,53,75,249,102,16,151,9,20,31,152,142,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
