Could that be any more absurd? The Obamacare rollout didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t roll over anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t crush an American city. In Katrina, people were being stripped of everything they had. In Obamacare, there is a delay in getting people something that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never had. During Katrina, people were living in appalling conditions of squalor while Bush sat on his hands. Today, people are experiencing difficulties with a website, while Obama scrambles to fix the problems.\n\nThe only valid comparison between Obamacare and Katrina is in the fact that in both cases, people are being denied help because they are poor or black or both. And in both cases, the problem is being caused by Republicans. The bigÃ¢â‚¬â€and undiscussedÃ¢â‚¬â€problem with Obamacare is that states can opt out of the Medicaid expansion. 8 million poor people in Republican-controlled states are being denied healthcare. Those people are being left stranded just as surely as the people on their roofs during Katrina. The only difference is that all of the people left without healthcare arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t being herded into the Super Dome, where the whole world can see the misery being caused.\n\nSome people are even comparing the ACA rollout to the Iraq war. Iraq was one of the biggest foreign policy disasters in American history. Obamacare is one of the greatest social policy victories in American history. There is no equivalency. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the opposite of equivalence! Comparing Iraq to Obamacare is like comparing the sinking of the Titanic to the moon landing.\n\nA new report says that the healthcare system in the United States is lousy compared to other developed countries. We either have to fix it, or start comparing ourselves to much less developed countries. We have to go down a couple of levels when it comes to comparing our healthcare system to other countries. Australia and Sweden might make us look bad, but I bet we can still kick HaitiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ass.\n\nFinally, MSNBCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Martin Bashir has suggested that somebody should take a crap in Sarah PalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mouth. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s totally uncalled forÃ¢â‚¬â€thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already enough crap coming from Sarah PalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mouth as it is. Bashir was lambasting Palin over her comparison of the national debt to slavery. With Sarah spewing crap like that, who needs to add to it?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c9b63e5fe75cebe1712e7711ef052db864c46f3","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+18+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c9b63e5fe75cebe1712e7711ef052db864c46f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,155,99,229,254,117,206,190,23,18,231,113,30,240,82,219,134,76,70,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
