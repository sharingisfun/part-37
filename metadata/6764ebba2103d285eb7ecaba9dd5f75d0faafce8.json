When he accidentally freezes himself on December 31, 1999, he wakes up 1,000 years in the future and has a chance to make a fresh start. He goes to work for the Planet Express Corporation, a futuristic delivery service that transports packages to all five quadrants of the universe. His companions include the delivery ship's captain, Leela, a beautiful one-eyed female alien who kicks some serious butt, and Bender, a robot with very human flaws.\n\n\nThis is the complete Futurama series with movies. I recommend watching the last episode first and then watching seasons 1-7.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6764ebba2103d285eb7ecaba9dd5f75d0faafce8","amp;dn":"Futurama+Complete.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6764ebba2103d285eb7ecaba9dd5f75d0faafce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,100,235,186,33,3,210,133,235,126,202,186,157,213,247,93,15,170,252,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
