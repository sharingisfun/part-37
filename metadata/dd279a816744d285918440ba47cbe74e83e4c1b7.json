He has to put his wild days behind him and do what fathers do best: be responsible. He is too rebellious. He is too wild. He is going to try &quot;just one more raid&quot; on the three nastiest, meanest farmers that are Boggis, Bunce and Bean. It is a tale of crossing the line of family responsibilities and midnight adventure and the friendships and awakenings of this country life that is inhabited by Fantastic Mr. Fox and his friends.\n\n2010 Academy Awards Nomination for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year\n\nIMDb RATING: 8.2/10 (11,461 votes) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432283/\n\nRuntime......: 83 Min\nSource.......: DVD5\nResolution...: 720x384\nSA...........: BVOP: YES QPEL: NO GMC: NO\nFramerate....: 23.976 NTSC\nVideo........: 2041 Kbps\nAudio........: 448 Kbps AC3 5.1\nLanguage.....: English\nEncoder......: DjDayV\n\ncredit ViSiON &amp; DjDayV &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd279a816744d285918440ba47cbe74e83e4c1b7","amp;dn":"Fantastic.Mr.Fox.2009.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd279a816744d285918440ba47cbe74e83e4c1b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,39,154,129,103,68,210,133,145,132,64,186,71,203,231,78,131,228,193,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
