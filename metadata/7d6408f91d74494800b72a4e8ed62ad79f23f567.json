On Crystal Bowl Meditation, they utilize pure quartz crystal bowls, which emit an ethereal and penetrating field of vibration, acting as a carrier wave for the healing tones of flutes, keyboard, and Moog synthesizers. Your body becomes a sympathetic resonator, in sync with the perfect harmonic patterns of this musical alchemy. Inner visions arise, cellular healing unfolds, and deep meditation opens its mysteries.\n\nLife in Balance (the wife-and-husband team Ami and Steve Sciulli) are pioneers in ambient and trance-inducing electro-acoustic music. Together they create music that is a synthesis of New Age, ambient, and electronic, with influences from Fripp, Eno, Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, and Peter Gabriel. They perform sound healing meditations and hypno-global trance concerts nationwide. They have played with Deepak Chopra, Rusted Root, Krishna Das, and The Drepung Gomang Tibetan Monks. Steve has opened for U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Echo and the Bunnymen.\n\n60 min\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSecure rip and all tracks AccurateRip verified.
