He became famous in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his band, Santana, which created a highly successful blend of rock, salsa, and jazz fusion. The band's sound featured his melodic, blues-based guitar lines set against Latin percussion such as timbales and congas. Santana continued to work in these forms over the following decades. He experienced a sudden resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. Carlos Santana has been known as &quot;The Carlos&quot;. Rolling Stone also named Santana number 15 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time in 2003.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6b644ea8664f9b851daedcac9a08c37106672c7","amp;dn":"Santana+feat.+Musiq+-+Nothing+At+All","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6b644ea8664f9b851daedcac9a08c37106672c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,182,68,234,134,100,249,184,81,218,237,202,201,160,140,55,16,102,114,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
