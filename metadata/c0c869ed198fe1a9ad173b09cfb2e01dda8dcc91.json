It\ndepicts a procession of Roman soldiers carrying the seven-branched candlestick and the table of showbread and the silver trumpets which they took from the Jewish temple in Jerusalem before its destruction in 70 A.D.\n\nThe Jewish eye-witness and great Non-Christian Historian Josephus wrote around 75\nA.D. that, after destroying the temple in Jerusalem at the conclusion of the 63-70 A.D. Jewish War, the Pagan Roman General ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTitus took the journey...back to Rome.... His father [Emperor Vespasian, likewise a Pagan,] met and received him...crowned with laurel....\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat afforded the greatest surprise of all, was the structure of the pageants that were borne along.... The Jews related what...they had undergone during this war.... Other spoils...were carried in great plenty. For of those that were taken in the temple of Jerusalem, they made the greatest figure of them all: that is, the golden table of the weight of many talents; the candlestick also.... Last of all...was carried the Law of the Jews.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVespasian marched in the first place..... Titus followed. Domitian [TitusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s younger and even more ungodly brother] also rode along with them, and made a glorious appearance and rode on a horse that was worthy of admiration.... Vespasian resolved to build [in Rome] a temple to peace.... He also laid up therein, as ensigns of his glory, those golden vessels and instruments that were taken out of \nthe Jewish temple....\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere is now that great city [of Jerusalem], the metropolis of the Jewish nation?.....\n\nWhere is this city that was believed to have God Himself inhabiting therein? It is now demolished to the very foundations.... Nor did He permit any who were desirous of worshipping God there, so much as to come near the whole sacred place.... He made it entirely inaccessible.... There remained no longer the least footsteps of any divine worship.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nJosephus: Wars of the Jews VII:5:3-7 &amp; 8:7 &amp; 10:4.\nThus suffered those ungodly Judaists, who had killed the Lord Jesus and their own\nProphets. They had persecuted the Christians and their Apostles, forbidding them to speak salvation to the Gentiles. They had filled up their sins. For the wrath had come upon them, to the uttermost, at the end of the 63-70 A.D. Seven YearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreat Tribulation.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThis was by far quite the greatest time of trouble or tribulation the World had ever seen, or ever would see. Not only in Judea, but also internationally. See: Daniel 9:24-27; 12:1-7; Matthew 24:15-28; Luke 21:20-24; First Thessalonians 2:14-16; Hebrews 12:22-27; 13:10-14; Revelation 1:9; 2:10; 3:10; 6:12-17; 7:14; 11:2f ; 12:6-14; etc.\n\nA.D. 63f: Beginning of the Romano-Jewish War T S\nA.D. 63f: Britain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œexcitedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œturbulentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Tacitus) T R E\nA.D. 64f: Nero burns Rome but blames the Christians H I V\nA.D. 66f: Roman Titus encircles Jerusalem a-mid tribulation E B E\nA.D. 67f: Unusual signs, earthquakes and famines et cetera U N\nA.D. 69: Rome herself torched in the Roman Civil War G L\nA.D. 69f: International turmoil throughout the Roman Empire R A Y\nA.D. 69f: Ongoing Romano-British battles in Britain E T E\nA.D. 69f: Jewish holocaust throughout Palestine A I A\nA.D. 70: Destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem T O R\nA.D. 70: Close of Biblical Canon. Daniel 9:24f &amp; Revelation 22:18f N S\n\nJesus and Josephus and Suetonius and Tacitus on the 64 to 70 A.D. Fall of Jerusalem\nJesus, during His Own earthly lifetime and before the end of 35 A.D., predicted that the old Jerusalem would die within that very same generation. See Matthew 24:15,28,34 cf.\n\nMark 13:14-30 &amp; Luke 21:20-24. That ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgenerationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ apparently lasted forty years; and\ntherefore ended before 75 A.D. Hebrews 3:7-10,17 &amp; 13:12-14.\n\nHowever, before Jerusalem expired, from her dying womb the Saviour first delivered\nthe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew JerusalemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of His Christian Church. Matthew 24:8; Mark 13:8 f ; John 16:19-21; cf. First Thessalonians 5:3. See too the 50-58 A.D. book of Galatians 4:4-6 &amp; 4:21-26 (q.v.!); the 60-65 A.D. book of Matthew (23:1-37 to 24:34f); the 60-65 A.D. book of Mark (13:l-30f); and the 65-69 A.D. book of Luke (17:22-37 &amp; 21:5-32f &amp; 23:28-31). Compare also the circa A.D. 66 Epistle to the Hebrews (8:4-12 &amp; 9:25 &amp; 10:11 &amp;11:13-16 &amp; 12:22f &amp; 13:10-14);and the 68-69 A.D. book of Revelation (1:1-19 &amp; 2:9-10 &amp; 3:9-10 &amp; 6:4-17 &amp; 7:4-7 &amp; 8:5-8f &amp; 11:1,2,8 &amp; 12:1-6 &amp; 21:1-10 &amp; &amp; 22:16f).\n\nThe fulfilment of these predictions in the Bible, are clearly chronicled by the famousNon-Christian Judaistic Ancient Historian Josephus (A.D. 37-100f), in his work The Jewish War (II:13:2 to VI:9:4). Writing between A.D. 75 and 79, this Pro-Roman Judaistic Scholar dramatically described the last terrible years of the old Jerusalem (64-70 A.D.).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c869ed198fe1a9ad173b09cfb2e01dda8dcc91","amp;dn":"John%5C%27s+Apocalypse+Written+Before+70+A.D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0c869ed198fe1a9ad173b09cfb2e01dda8dcc91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,200,105,237,25,143,225,169,173,23,59,9,207,178,224,29,218,141,204,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
