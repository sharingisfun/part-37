This ground-breaking concert film has been completely digitally restored, enhanced and remastered in Dolby Digital 2.0 and 5.1 in time for this DVD release! Directed with the raw energy of the Minneapolis rocker himself, the movie is punctuated with specially filmed, dramatic vignettes appearing occasionally between songs. Drummer Sheila E. rocks the house and Sheena Easton makes a special appearance to strut her stuff. You won't want to miss these sizzling live renditions of his hits such as &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; and &quot;U Got the Look&quot;.
