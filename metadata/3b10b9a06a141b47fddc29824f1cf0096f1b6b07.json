Her toolbox approach to weight loss is different from standard one-size-fits-all programs because you don't need to adapt to the plan; this plan adapts to you. It introduces you to the four types of tools that must work together for effective weight loss: eating, activity, behavior, and medical/biological. Do you overeat from stress or boredom? Do you like to exercise alone or with a group? The answers to these questions and others will unlock the unique weight-loss toolkit that's right for you. With some honest self-evaluation, you'll be able to explore and compare all of the options for weight loss in a single book. The right combination of tools, hand-picked by you, will support your weight loss and, later, weight stability over the long haul.\n\n\nHelps you develop your own unique path to weight loss?not a one-size-fits-all approach\nAddresses the four key areas for successful weight loss: eating, activity, behavior, and medical/biology\nIncludes self-assessment quizzes and mini-tools to put into action right away\nShows you how to keep going through plateaus and how to overcome obstacles\n\n\nThe Perfect World versus the Real World\n\n\nPerfect world: Never eat after 7 p.m. \nReal world: Allow one mini-meal at night (up to 200 calories).\n\nPerfect world: Avoid all fast food. \nReal world: Choose a kidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ meal.\n\nPerfect world: Visit the gym every day. \nReal world: Go to the gym at least three days a week.\n\nPerfect world: Cook a low-calorie dinner every night. \nReal world: Keep calorie-controlled frozen entrees on hand.\n\nPerfect world: Eliminate a late-afternoon snack to save calories. \nReal world: Plan your dinner hour and allow yourself 100 to 200 calories when dinner is two or three hours away.\n\nPerfect world: Walk and or/jog four miles on the treadmill daily. \nReal world: Wear a pedometer and monitor your steps during your daily living activity. Make up the daily difference on the treadmill (10,000 steps is about 4 miles).\n\n\nOnce youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve mastered the best tools for personal goal setting, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to incorporate your own good intentions into the Real You plan. Learn more about these and other goal-setting techniques in my book, The Real You Diet.\n\n\nFrom the Inside Flap\n\n\nDo you overeat when you feel bored or stressed out? Do you like to exercise alone or with a group? When it comes to diet and weight loss, no two people are alike. That's why one-size-fits-all programs that use the same approach for everyone are doomed to failÃ¢â‚¬â€and why The Real You Diet can help you succeed.\nCreated by Dr. Madelyn Fernstrom, one of the nation's leading weight-loss specialists and a regular diet and nutrition expert for the Today show and iVillage.com, The Real You Diet helps you develop a personalized program to lose weight and keep it off for good. First, Dr. Fernstrom guides you through a self-evaluation process to pinpoint the areas you need to focus on most and honestly assess the body, mind-set, and lifestyle factors that may be sabotaging your weight-loss efforts. She gives you a comprehensive set of tools to effect change in the four major areas that are crucial to losing weight: behavior, eating, activity, and medical/biological. The right combination of these tools, hand-picked by you for your personal toolkit, will support your weight loss and, later, weight stability for the long haul.\n\nEach area tackles major stumbling blocks you may encounter and shows you how to overcome them. You'll make the most of:\n\nBehavioral tools. Change habits, minimize mindless eating, and reward yourself without using food.\n\nEating/food tools. Avoid portion distortion, use reverse calorie counting, and become a positive snacker.\n\nActivity tools. Understand your physical activity, temperament, start moving every day, and much more.\n\nMedical/biological tools. Learn how to talk to your doctor, identify your biological barriers to weight loss, and make sense of supplements and medications.\n\nOnce you assemble your toolkit and put it to work, you can begin to see results in just eight weeks, and a twenty-one-day meal plan will help you get started. Along the way, you can add or take away tools as needed. Bored with your plan? Just replace some worn-out tools with new, more effective ones. Dr. Fernstrom guides you through each step of your journey to help you make, and keep, a personal connection and commitment to your goals as you work to achieve themÃ¢â‚¬â€your wayÃ¢â‚¬â€and discover the beauty of the real you.\n\n\nThe Real You Diet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ December 14, 2009\nBook Language: English \nPages: 259\nFile Type: Epub, Pdf, Mobi\nFile Size: 2.74 MB\n\n\nISBN-10: 0470371803\nISBN-13: 978-0470371800","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b10b9a06a141b47fddc29824f1cf0096f1b6b07","amp;dn":"The+Real+You+Diet+-+MADELYN+FERNSTROM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b10b9a06a141b47fddc29824f1cf0096f1b6b07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,16,185,160,106,20,27,71,253,220,41,130,79,28,240,9,111,27,107,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
