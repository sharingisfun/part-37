With that much time invested, their fan base grows like a weed and in turn, the &amp;#039;Villains stir their audiences into a frenzy that no other mainstream or underground act can hold a candle to. The results of these factors are in the band&amp;#039;s 4th studio release, Grow Yer Own. The album volleys splendidly throughout...going back and fourth from Operation Ivy speed punk to Sublime licked reggae, and (since the band comes from deep within the Florida Swamplands) at times Dom (drums) &amp; Skart&amp;#039;s (guitar) vocals will emphasize a catchy sing-along &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; type chorus all while keepin&amp;#039; a groove as deep as Funkadelic. Recently, the band has teamed up wtih Pepper, whose own Law Records will officially release &quot;Grow Yer Own&quot; on 4/20/2006 in support of a National tour that the two bands are about to embark on. \n\nwww.axismusicportal.com/Villain\nwww.thesupervillains.net. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beef89b1e433d585f58782ae3fbe722020ec6c7c","amp;dn":"The+Supervillains+-+Grown+Yer+Own","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beef89b1e433d585f58782ae3fbe722020ec6c7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,239,137,177,228,51,213,133,245,135,130,174,63,190,114,32,32,236,108,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
