While it keeps clear of metaphysical correlations and is solely focused on scientifically verifiable data, it also has philosophical repercussions pertaining to life, death and the origin of the universe. Due to its many layers and density in presentation, it may require multiple readings to fully comprehend its implications, even though considerable effort has been made to simplify the complex scientific concepts that are discussed. Furthermore, I would like to thank the author for allowing me to follow and report on his work, as he wanted to remain dedicated to his research and avoid becoming involved in its media coverage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07c44a4389665a2bed67d20112af03bc7b5bc899","amp;dn":"Athene%27s+Theory+of+Everything.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07c44a4389665a2bed67d20112af03bc7b5bc899","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,196,74,67,137,102,90,43,237,103,210,1,18,175,3,188,123,91,200,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
