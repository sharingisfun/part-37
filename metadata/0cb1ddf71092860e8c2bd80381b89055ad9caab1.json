This brilliant debut details the sordid exploits of Jack, an alcoholic would-be card-counter living in Las Vegas. His life (as well as that of his showgirl girlfriend, Gina) takes an unexpected turn when he crosses paths with the seemingly benevolent club owner, Rex. This gripping pastiche of Jim Thompson and the U.S. Playing Card Company also includes a fascinating demonstration of full-color no-glasses 3-D Comics.\n\n\nSome other books by Jason Little...\n\nJason Little - Motel Art Improvement Service &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7767099/Jason_Little_-_Motel_Art_Improvement_Service&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7767099/Jason_Little_-_Motel_Art_Improvement_Service&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJason Little - Shutterbug Follies &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7767092/Jason_Little_-_Shutterbug_Follies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7767092/Jason_Little_-_Shutterbug_Follies&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cb1ddf71092860e8c2bd80381b89055ad9caab1","amp;dn":"Jason+Little+-+Jack%27s+Luck+Runs+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cb1ddf71092860e8c2bd80381b89055ad9caab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,177,221,247,16,146,134,14,140,43,216,3,129,184,144,85,173,156,170,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
