Once bootloader unlocked, official sony tools do not work anymore. \n2. Using official sony tools, you can only upgrade. No downgrade possible.\n3. Using flashtool, you can choose what to flash and what not to flash. This said, many rooting scenarios are available implying kernel only downgrade to retrieve a patched rooting exploit and then flash back the right kernel.\n\nMany other features have been built-in so that Flashtool can also be used to (as far as the phone is recognized by Flashtool) :\n\n    Root your phone\n    Install recovery, busybox, custom kernels\n    Clean your rom (remove /system/apps apps of your choice) (Be careful, unless you really know what you do, do not modify the default list. This can make your phone stuck at the SE Logo)\n    Clear dalvik cache\n    Optimize (install of JIT v2) (plugin for 2.1 phones only from 2010 line)\n    Customize (installs apps found in the custom/apps folder of the flashtool)\n    Edit any text file on the device\n    Rebrand your device\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8591f601ee07160955190b59781d8276601bb299","amp;dn":"flashtool-0.9.13.0-windows.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8591f601ee07160955190b59781d8276601bb299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,145,246,1,238,7,22,9,85,25,11,89,120,29,130,118,96,27,178,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
