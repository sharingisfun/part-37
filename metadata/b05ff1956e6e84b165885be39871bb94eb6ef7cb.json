On his solo project, Slash&amp;#039;s Snakepit, he plays a lot and most of his playing is quite amazing. It&amp;#039;s too bad that nobody in the band bothered to write any songs.\n-AllMusic 4.5/5\n\nProbably the worst review I&amp;#039;ve ever read for an album that got such a high rating but if you are a fan of the type of music Slash was known for back in his prime you will love this album. It&amp;#039;s really a forgotten classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b05ff1956e6e84b165885be39871bb94eb6ef7cb","amp;dn":"Slash%5C%27s+Snakepit-+It%5C%27s+FIve+0%5C%27Clock+Somewhere+192k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b05ff1956e6e84b165885be39871bb94eb6ef7cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,95,241,149,110,110,132,177,101,136,91,227,152,113,187,148,235,110,247,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
