Lament to the Earl of Bottesford Beck\n\nAmazing Blondel's fourth album is a gorgeous evocation of the England that seems to exist in so many of the land's loveliest folk songs, a peaceful world of picturesque farming folk, doughty fishermen, immortal sunsets, and halcyon summers. Just six songs convey this impression, all dominated by the side-long three-piece suite &quot;The Paintings,&quot; which places into words and gentle orchestrations the impressions conjured by the imagery of &quot;Seascape,&quot; &quot;Landscape,&quot; and &quot;Afterglow.&quot; Described by the band itself as &quot;three pastoral settings for voices, flute, guitars and orchestra,&quot; it's an incredibly ambitious piece, but never so much that it loses sight of its intrinsic romance. Played alongside Roy Harper's &quot;One of Those Days in England,&quot; it could set even the sternest expatriate's thoughts winging homewards. The shorter songs are less entrancing, with &quot;A Spring Air&quot; coming so close to TV ad theme territory that one can almost see the spring lambs bouncing through fields of freshly laundered shirts and sheets. The chanted &quot;Cantus Firmus to Counterpoint,&quot; however, is a stirringly churchical piece, with just a hint of &quot;We Three Kings of Orient Are&quot; floating around the melody, while &quot;Sinfonia for Guitar and Strings&quot; is as well executed as its title suggests it ought to be. The finest moment, however, has to be the Gothic organ-led &quot;Lament to the Earl of Bottesford Beck,&quot; whose own country churchyard tones take listeners straight back to the start of the album, and another 20 minutes spent with &quot;The Paintings.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c9888ffb3d0b116d277dd15660ac88c7fbabc1","amp;dn":"Amazing+Blondel+-+England+%5B1972%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c9888ffb3d0b116d277dd15660ac88c7fbabc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,201,136,143,251,61,11,17,109,39,125,209,86,96,172,136,199,251,171,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
