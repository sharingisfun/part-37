They were met by \na diverse group of activists, ranging from youthful peace-punks to veteran trade \nunion members, who intended to publicly air their concerns about issues of economic \njustice, Third World labor policies, and environmental safety that were being \nignored by many of the WTO's affiliates. Police soon clashed with the protesters, the \nvast majority of which were gathered peacefully and had obtained permits for their \ngatherings. While Seattle authorities attempted to portray the protesters as a violent \nrabble in statements to the media, a number of activists armed with film and video \ncameras were on hand to document the protests, who then used the Internet and \nindependent media outlets to bring their side of the story to the public. \n\nThis Is What Democracy Looks Like was compiled by directors Jill Friedberg and Rick \nRowley from material shot by more than a hundred &quot;media activists&quot; who captured a \nside of the WTO protests largely ignored by the mainstream news media. \nThis Is What Democracy Looks Like is narrated by actress Susan Sarandon and Michael \nFranti, leader of the leftist hip-hop group Spearhead; radical rock band Rage Against \nthe Machine also appears in the film.\n\nExtras included: \n\n* Interviews with Noam Chomsky and Vandana Shiva.\n* WTO protests in Cancun 2003.\n* The Birth Of Indymedia.\n* Previews of: The Fourth World War, Black &amp; Gold, Zapatista and Granito de Arena.\n* ActivistResources.pdf\n\nCover Included.\n\nMore related material:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec4b6529863de910c88ddda09574acece5ff8a62","amp;dn":"This.Is.What.Democracy.Looks.Like.2000.NTSC-DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec4b6529863de910c88ddda09574acece5ff8a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,75,101,41,134,61,233,16,200,141,221,160,149,116,172,236,229,255,138,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
