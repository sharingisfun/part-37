Last Friday they released The Finder and yet it wasn't even broadcast in Canada and still the scene group's nukers let it through as acceptable. Faking capping from Canada is one annoying thing but creating a fictional broadcast is a bit much for most peoples' sanity. \n\n \n               Criminal Minds | s07e21 | WEB-DL | Divining Rod\n\n\nIN THIS EPISODE\n\nMere minutes after the execution of an infamous serial killer, a copycat begins to commit crimes in the same town with the same MO. The BAU is forced to act fast Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the UnSub isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wasting any time, and bodies are being found every six hours. As the team meets with the executed killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex wife in a search for suspects, the UnSub begins to escalate his plan. While the first two women murdered are found with cut hair, the third is discovered with a shaved head. The fourth body is found after having been scalped entirely.\n\n\nFILE SPECS\n\nComplete name                            : Criminal.Minds.s07e21.WEB-DLXviD-jAh.avi\nFile size                                : 349 MiB\nDuration                                 : 42mn 31s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 1149 Kbps\nWriting application                      : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.3 | www.virtualdub-fr.org || (build 2550/release)\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 2\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.192\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.5 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                                : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 149 ms\nWriting library                          : LAME3.99 \nEncoding settings                        : -m s -V 4 -q 0 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a50718ec83ab9e45db004f2b008df85f9274ef0","amp;dn":"Criminal.Minds.s07e21.WEB-DLXviD-jAh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a50718ec83ab9e45db004f2b008df85f9274ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,80,113,142,200,58,185,228,93,176,4,242,176,8,223,133,249,39,78,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
