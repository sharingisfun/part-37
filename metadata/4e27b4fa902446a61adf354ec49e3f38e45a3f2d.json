Basically, a short floppy vinyl record that was essentially a radio drama of the issue it was saddle stitched into.\n\nI've included MP3s of both sides of that record to go with the recently ripped omnibus edition of Nexus Vol. 1. All hail the original editors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e27b4fa902446a61adf354ec49e3f38e45a3f2d","amp;dn":"Nexus+Vol.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e27b4fa902446a61adf354ec49e3f38e45a3f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,39,180,250,144,36,70,166,26,223,53,78,196,158,63,56,228,90,63,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
