One of the greatest and most popular of all West Indian cricketers, he left the game to become, among other things, a barrister, cabinet minister, diplomat, broadcaster, author and journalist. The first black man to enter the House of Lords, he was a tireless campaigner for racial equality and West Indian self-government whose forthright response to racial discrimination led to a celebrated legal case that laid the foundations for Britain s first Race Relations Act. Above all, however, he was an immensely popular public figure throughout his life; a man whose easy charm and warm personality won the hearts of countless admirers in walks of life that were far from his humble beginnings in the hills of Trinidad. Journalist and cricket writer Peter Mason tells the fascinating story of this cricketer turned activist, underlining his lasting contributions to both sport and to the fight against racism.\n\n \n \nSource:\n\nLearie Constantine by Peter Mason \n\nPublished by Macmillan (UK) - 2008\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab3e96ddde83449dbd23d5a15e5489f0d73ff89f","amp;dn":"Learie+Constantine+-+Biography+%282008%29+-+Author+Peter+Mason+-+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab3e96ddde83449dbd23d5a15e5489f0d73ff89f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,62,150,221,222,131,68,157,189,35,213,161,94,84,137,240,215,63,248,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
