It consists of a series of sketches which come together to form an overall story. Since all the action takes place, and nearly all the characters live, in the same village, there is much overlap, and the events and characters of one story play a part in the lives of others, much as in a soap opera. There is usually a main plot to which the minor stories tend to be tenuously connected.\n\nIn the radio series, the plot involved outsider Benjamin Denton visiting his aunt and uncle in Spent to be interviewed for a job at the local power plant. \nNot surprisingly, he missed the interview and was forced to stay longer than expected.\n\nOn The Town was first aired on Radio 4 on 6th November 1997.\n\n\n\nCharacters\n\nReece Shearsmith \n\nBenjamin Denton - Media student &amp; Nephew of Val &amp; Harvey Denton\nBernice Woodall - Spent FM DJ and agony aunt.
