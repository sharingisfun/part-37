There are four news reports from \nAustralia that contain interviews all on the farewell tour when it was down under.PLUS! the same 8mm\nfootage from 1973-74 that is on tape #430,only this has dubbed in soundboard audio that fits great with\nthe images.You really can hardly tell that the audio has been dubbed in.PLUS!
