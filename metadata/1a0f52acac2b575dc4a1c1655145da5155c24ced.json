The seeding was terrible as it took 6 whole days to download. So upon finishing, i decided to put it out there myself and hopefully it'll go faster for others than it originally did for me.\n\nThis is, to me, the Holy Grail of Genesis concert videos. I have this packed away somewhere on VHS and haven't seen it in years till i grabbed it off the 'net. The video is exactly as it was on VHS with no extras. As is. Don't expect 2009 quality.\n\nTitle: Genesis - MAMA Tour (Japanese release)\nYear: 1984\nISBN: SM068-3095\n\nChapters:\n1. Abacab\n2. That's All\n3. Mama\n4. Illegal Alien\n5. Home by the Sea\n6. Keep it Dark\n7. It's Gonna Get Better\n8. In the Cage (medley: Cinema Show/In that Quiet Earth/Colony of Slippermen/Afterglow)\n9. Drum Duet\n10. Turn it on Again (final medley)\n\nCredit goes to the original creator of this torrent file, HALF-EATEN. His info text file is included intact.\n\nSo, without further ado.......\n\n\n\nComments always welcome.  ;-))","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a0f52acac2b575dc4a1c1655145da5155c24ced","amp;dn":"Genesis+-+Mama+Tour+%28from+laser+disc%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a0f52acac2b575dc4a1c1655145da5155c24ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,15,82,172,172,43,87,93,196,161,193,101,81,69,218,81,85,194,76,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
