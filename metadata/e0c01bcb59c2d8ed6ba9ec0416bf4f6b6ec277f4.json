Everywhere people would go they would hear these songs. - Big Papi\nimage\n\nBy A Customer\nAce of Base's debut effort, The Sign, is probably the best of the nineties. Aside from selling 21 million copies around the globe, and from being the #1 album of 1994, it is truly creative. From the opening track &quot;All That She Wants&quot; that includes the feel of Jamaican beaches and features their signature reggae-pop beats, it is a non-stop tour of Euro-dance and reggae-pop! &quot;Don't Turn Around&quot; is a powerful lost-love song that echoes with Linn's dramatic vocals and Jenny's heartbreaking back-ups. &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Living In Danger&quot;, &quot;Dancer in a Daydream&quot;, &quot;Happy Nation&quot;- these are the album's best tracks. The Bangrha version of &quot;ATSW&quot; could have done better off of the CD, maybe replaced with one of their European tracks, like &quot;Hear Me Calling&quot;, and the 7&quot; Remix of &quot;Waiting for Magic&quot; totally kills the original version of the song that is on the European album (The original version of &quot;WFM&quot; is very good). The standout song is the title track, &quot;The Sign&quot;, which is a fun, poppy song that, aside from being their biggest hit, is a meaningful track that brings life to to the whole record. This is the best album of the decade, so GET IT!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0c01bcb59c2d8ed6ba9ec0416bf4f6b6ec277f4","amp;dn":"Ace+of+Base+-+The+Sign+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1993+Swedish+Dance+Pop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0c01bcb59c2d8ed6ba9ec0416bf4f6b6ec277f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,192,27,203,89,194,216,237,107,169,236,4,22,191,79,107,110,194,119,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
