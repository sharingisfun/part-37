These form the crux of building Linux firewalls and QOS. The later part of the book covers 5 real-world networks for which we design the security policies, build the firewall, setup the script, and verify our installation. These comprehensive set of set up scripts and set up guidelines to create firewall protection for various specific usage scenarios are unique and set this book apart.\n\n288 pages | PDF | 9 Mb\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bbf2e38aeac4483e9beefdadc9217e667cad9a1","amp;dn":"Designing+And+Implementing+Linux+Firewalls+And+QoS+%282006%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bbf2e38aeac4483e9beefdadc9217e667cad9a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,191,46,56,174,172,68,131,233,190,239,218,220,146,23,230,103,202,217,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
