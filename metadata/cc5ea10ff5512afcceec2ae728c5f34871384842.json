Various cancer survivors are presented in the film who chose these medicines instead of surgery, chemotherapy or radiation - with full disclosure of medical records to support their diagnosis and recovery - as well as systematic (non-anecdotal) FDA-supervised clinical trial data comparing Antineoplastons to other available treatmentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which is published within the peer-reviewed medical literature.\n\nOne form of cancer - diffuse, intrinsic, childhood brainstem glioma has never before been cured in any scientifically controlled clinical trial in the history of medicine. Antineoplastons hold the first cures in history - dozens of them. [ANP - PubMed 2003] [ANP - PubMed 2006] [Rad &amp; other - PubMed 2008] [Chemo/Rad - PubMed 2005]\n\nThis documentary takes the audience through the treacherous, yet victorious, 14-year journey both Dr. Burzynski and his patients have had to endure in order to obtain FDA-approved clinical trials of Antineoplastons.\n\nDr. Burzynski resides and practices medicine in Houston, Texas. He was able to initially produce and administer his discovery without FDA-approval from 1977-1995 because the state of Texas at this time did not require that Texas physicians be required to adhere to Federal law in this situation. This law has since been changed.\n\nAs with anything that changes current-day paradigms, Burzynski\\'s ability to successfully treat incurable cancer with such consistency has baffled the industry. Ironically, this fact had prompted numerous investigations by the Texas Medical Board, who relentlessly took Dr. Burzynski as high as the state supreme court in their failed attempt to halt his practices.\n\nLikewise, the Food and Drug Administration engaged in four Federal Grand Juries spanning over a decade attempting to indict Dr. Burzynski, all of which ended in no finding of fault on his behalf. Finally, Dr. Burzynski was indicted in their 5th Grand Jury in 1995, resulting in two federal trials and two sets of jurors finding him not guilty of any wrongdoing. If convicted, Dr. Burzynski would have faced a maximum of 290 years in a federal prison and $18.5 million in fines.\n\nHowever, what was revealed a few years after Dr. Burzynski won his freedom, helps to paint a more coherent picture regarding the true motivation of the United States government\\'s relentless persecution of Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nNote: When Antineoplastons are approved for pubic use, it will allow a single scientist to hold an exclusive license to manufacture and sell these medicines on the open marketÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½before they become genericÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½leaving PhRMA absent in profiting from the most effective gene-targeted cancer treatment the world has ever seen. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.burzynskimovie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.burzynskimovie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc5ea10ff5512afcceec2ae728c5f34871384842","amp;dn":"Burzynski.The.Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc5ea10ff5512afcceec2ae728c5f34871384842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,94,161,15,245,81,42,252,206,236,42,231,40,197,243,72,113,56,72,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
