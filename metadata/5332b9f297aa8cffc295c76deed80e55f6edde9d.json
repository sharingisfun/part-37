Released by Paramount Pictures and utilizing top-tier talent like composer Alex North, cinematographer Joseph Biroc, and production designer Boris Leven, Shanks is an exceedingly strange film, a horror-fantasy punctuated by stretches of dialogue-free narrative, morbid black comedy, and occasional sentimentality. Unfortunately, the tone of the film is inconsistent and shaky, as are the motivations of the hero, a mute puppeteer played by Marceau. The unique premise is also subverted in the final quarter as the film takes an unexpected turn.\n\n\n Marcel Marceau ...  Malcolm Shanks / Old Walker \n Tsilla Chelton ...
