In 1977 the internet hadn't been invented, yet and cable T.V. wasn't as common as it is today, so a lot of Europeans (and probably even some Americans) weren't too familiar with that strange new world, America. And maybe in those times it was possible to accept all of &quot;This Is America&quot; as given, shocking facts. Watching the movie today, however, it is nothing short of hilarious. In fact, I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.\n\nIt all starts out relatively tamely with a report on Jello Biafra running for mayor and his punk band Dead Kennedys singing &quot;California Uber Alles&quot;. So far, so good, but soon it all gets over the top as we get to know Captain Sticky, a self-proclaimed super-hero, who's out to fight all unjustness. The voice-over comments Sticky's ridiculous evil-seeking devices so dryly and without any sense of irony that the whole thing becomes even more laughable. The movie continues with reports on homeless people living in the sewers, satanic rituals, swinger discos and - the comedic highlight - a day in the life of a New York bounty hunter. There's violence, there's sex and some more violence. What more could you ask for?\n\nI can only recommend &quot;This Is America Part 2&quot; to anyone with a good sense of humor. Personally, I can't wait to see part 3. If it's only remotely as good as the first two entries in the series, then this franchise rivals &quot;The Godfather&quot; for best trilogy ever. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141902/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141902/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c6ff357ae50639a738c4921846ca017636716a4","amp;dn":"This+Is+America+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c6ff357ae50639a738c4921846ca017636716a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,111,243,87,174,80,99,154,115,140,73,33,132,108,160,23,99,103,22,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
