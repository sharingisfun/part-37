It ties in closely with the characters and story-line from the first one, so you probably don't want to start a new game on Bravely Second with out first having played Bravely Default..\r\n\r\nThis is a single .3ds file inside of a .7z archive file..\r\n\r\nYou will need a gateway card (or some kind of CFW) to run it on your 3DS..\r\nAlso, make sure your gateway software is updated to the newest version..\r\nAt the time of this writing you need to have your sysnand on 9.2.0 or lower.. However if you have 10.3 or lower, there is a way that you can downgrade your sysnand to 9.2.0. (You will need to research it on a site like gbatemp.net to figure out how to do it).. But if you are on sysnand 10.4 or higher, it is not possible (at the time of this writing) to downgrade or hack your 3DS with out using a hardware-modified 3DS and a back-up of your NAND before it was updated in to an unhackable version range..\r\n\r\nI have confirmed it to work at least with this set up:\r\nnew-3DS\r\nsysnand: 9.2.0\r\nemunand: 10.4.0\r\ngateway launcher software version: 3.7.1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6be04a078ec0d974648eac6d1031fe1ec461aa8b","amp;dn":"%5B3DS%5D+Bravely+Second%3A+End+Layer+%5BJPN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6be04a078ec0d974648eac6d1031fe1ec461aa8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,224,74,7,142,192,217,116,100,142,172,109,16,49,254,30,196,97,170,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
