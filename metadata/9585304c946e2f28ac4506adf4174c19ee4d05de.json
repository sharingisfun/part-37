The main characters are a White Russian emigre General involved in information gathering and influence and his Greek painter wife.  Their day to day interactions take place against the backdrop of immense change in Europe - Stalin's Russia, Nazi Germany, the Spanish Civil War and the election of the Popular Front government in France.  His meetings with white Russian colleagues and even the discussions with thieir neighbours (Communist supporters of the Popular Front) reflect these developments in France, Spain, Russia and Germany Rohmer uses newsreel footage throughtout the film to pace the development of the story.  Is the main character true to his Tsarist roots, a spy for the Communistrs or an agent of the Nazis?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9585304c946e2f28ac4506adf4174c19ee4d05de","amp;dn":"Triple+Agent+-+Eric+Rohmer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9585304c946e2f28ac4506adf4174c19ee4d05de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,133,48,76,148,110,47,40,172,69,6,173,244,23,76,25,238,77,5,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
