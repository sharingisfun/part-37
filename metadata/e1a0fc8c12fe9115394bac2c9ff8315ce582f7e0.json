You'll learn how to set up a safe and suitable working environment, how to prepare the surface of the wood for finishing, and how to choose the right stain to color the wood. At the core of the book are step-by-step techniques for six classic hand-applied finishes: shellac (including French polishing), oil, varnish, lacquer, water-based finish, and milk paint. Each technique is clearly and concisely explained, with many sharp photos and detailed drawings to accompany the text.\n\n\n\n\nReview\nThe hear of Hand-Applied Finishes is Jeff Jewitt's carefully researched, step-by-step discussion of traditional hand-applied finishes and the techniques for applying them. Included are shellac, applied French polishing, padding and brushing, oil finishes, varnishes, solvent lacquers, water-based finishes and milk paint. Jewitt points out the importance of the finishing environment, and shows the correct use of stains, dyes, and wood fillers in a separate chapter on coloring wood. On-site photos clarify virtually every detail. Hand-Applied Finishes is organized in the logical sequence for finishing, so readers get a realistic look at the process, which they can easily adapt to their own projects. Jewitt stresses the practical side of hand finishing, and happily for most, has not burdened his very readable and useful book with unnecessary chemistry jargon and theory. Hand-Applied Finishes is an essential book for all finishers, from the novice hobbiest to the experienced professionals. The Taunton Press also has two companion videos available: Hand-Applied Finishes: Coloring Wood ($19. 95) and Hand-Applied Finishes: Applying Topcoats ($19. 95). -- Midwest Book Review\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 192 pages\n    * Publisher: Taunton Press; First Edition edition (April 1, 1997)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1561581542\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1561581542","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1a0fc8c12fe9115394bac2c9ff8315ce582f7e0","amp;dn":"Hand-Applied+Finishes+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1a0fc8c12fe9115394bac2c9ff8315ce582f7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,160,252,140,18,254,145,21,57,75,172,44,159,248,49,92,229,130,247,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
