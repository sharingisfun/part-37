Composing and mixing has been a long time hobby, and will be for a long time yet! I first started playing around with music composition at 2001, but really got into it from around 2004. Since then I've been on and off, mixing a few tracks once in a while.\n\nMy main genre is trance, more specifically classic / progressive trance. Sometimes I compose some classical / soundtrack / cinematic stuff, good for practicing musical composing skills. \n\nI'm currently doing a Bachelor of Science, Computer Science (Honours) at the University of New South Wales. I have been doing an internship with Google Sydney, working on the maps team.\n\nGear\n\nAlmost all my mixing is done in software with FL Studio 9. I first picked up Fruityloops 3.5 many years ago, after hearing the startup demo song, which was a shortened version of Toby Emerson's Raindrops. I don't use much hardware or recording equipment.\n\nI've been moving more and more of my mastering to Pro Tools 8 LE, after falling in love with its compressor plugin. Has a nice mixing / recording interface, comes with some very high quality plug-ins and epic audio editing functionality. MIDI composition and drum sequencing is still quite lacking in Pro Tools 8 though.\n\nI run an Intel i5 760 Quad, with the onboard Realtek HD audio card, though an MBox Micro2 USB dongle ( they don't make those any more:( ) which turns up as an ASIO device. For headphones, I use a pair of Sennheiser HD280 Pros, nice entry level closed flat response studio monitoring circumaurals (recommend them!). Also, sometimes I plug in a MIDI keyboard or two and press notes. That's about it for hardware equipment. \n\nInfluences\n\nToby Emerson - my primary influence, it's old Toby that got me into the Trance genre at first.\n\nGareth Emery - this guys gaining a lot of popularity really really quick. He mixes in a wierd housey style though.\n\nRon van den Beuken - old school trance producer. He topped dutch dance charts for a damn good while. Had him on MSN too!\n\nSector 7 - was one of the few good bands on SoundClick, back then years ago.\n\nRikiB - Rich bass, catchy chords, very high quality pads, this guy influenced me quite a lot, especially on my pads and breaks.\n\nOneilio - Patrick O'neil, who was very good with composition. I think he's working now as a film/media music scorer after attending some music academy somewhere.\n\n\n\nFollow HyperNewbie on his Facebook. Show him some Likes !\n\n\n-------------------\nwww.hypernewbie.com\n-------------------\n\nI don't own these songs. Im seeding them as a favour to Xi (HyperNewbie)\n\nMake sure to spread the music around and SEED ! :D\n\n~ Andy/Yasa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56b6c9b5baa2868d0c5d165369c731376a20e574","amp;dn":"Trance+-+HyperNewbie+Collection+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56b6c9b5baa2868d0c5d165369c731376a20e574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,182,201,181,186,162,134,141,12,93,22,83,105,199,49,55,106,32,229,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
