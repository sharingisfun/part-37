If you don't have an undo scheme created already you will be asked if you want to create one. An undo scheme is necessary to restore your system to the same appearance it had before the first PlusPak scheme was  applied.\n\nTo create your own schemes simply make an empty scheme by dragging the &quot;Icon Scheme&quot; template from the Icon Schemes folder and then right click on the empty scheme and select &quot;Extract from Desktop.&quot; Stardock will provide more tools to help create Desktop Themes at a future date. \n\nNOTE TO OBJECT DESKTOP USERS: The Icon Schemes won't override any objects that have been assigned new icons via the &quot;Set as Default&quot; button on the first page of an object notebook. You must disable this option, by either selecting &quot;Reset to Default&quot; from the object that is now set to default, or by setting a new object to default and resetting from that object.\n\nAll trademarked names mentioned in this readme file are used for editorial purposes only, with no intention of infringing upon the trademarks.\n\nImportant:  Read this before using your copy of Stardock Systems' PlusPak\n\nStardock Systems, Inc.
