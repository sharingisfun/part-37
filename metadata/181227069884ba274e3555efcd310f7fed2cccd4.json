As usual\n differs from other broadcast networks including a missing performer in the concert\n portion at the end (which NBC delayed til 11:30pm). Other things noticed, part of\n John Furlongs speech was cut as well as other minor differences to that of CTV\n including the strange inclusion of montages and a medal ceremony in the middle of \n the event (as I assume there was some production delay, since CTV also took a long\n commercial break at that time).  If we can, we'll dust off a CTV recording for comparison.\n\n As a member and resident of the home country of Canada and host city of Vancouver. I \n have never felt prouder to be a Canadian and as Neil Young so gracefully put it. &quot;Long\n May You Run&quot;.\n\n Time permitting, we'll dust off a few more events before officially putting this Olympics\n to bed.\n\n\n\n            Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?\n                          &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e4808b978195918d97a487969d94908b89858d88ca8b9683&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n                            \n                                                          \n                                                   \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                         \n                                                   \n                          \n                                       \n                                                   \n                                     \n                             \n                         \n                  \n               RESPECT TO        \n        \n       \n       \n         FQM       \n   \n        \n                  2x    \n                        SunZero 2oo6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:181227069884ba274e3555efcd310f7fed2cccd4","amp;dn":"The.2010.Vancouver.Winter.Olympics.Closing.Ceremony.HDTV.XviD-2H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"181227069884ba274e3555efcd310f7fed2cccd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,18,39,6,152,132,186,39,78,53,85,239,205,49,15,127,237,44,204,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
