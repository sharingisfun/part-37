Or so you would think. Composer Howard Goodall uncovers the surprising and often secret history of the Christmas carol.\n\nFar from being accepted as part of the celebrations of Jesus' birth, over the centuries carols have been banned by both church and state. The carols we sing seem set in stone and yet they can have up to 400 regional variations. Individual carols have caused controversy - While Shepherds Watched had to be cleaned up by the Victorians for being too crude and there's a suspicion that O Come All Ye Faithful was a call to 18th century Jacobites to rebel.\n\nThe documentary celebrates the enduring power of the carol with a variety of performances from folk singer Bella Hardy to the choir of Truro Cathedral.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC in TS\nAudio: AC3 6ch 384Kbps in TS [Dolby Digital 5.1]\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1920*1080i to 1280*720p\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:002c9d34300c278dd09fd567b7c996a58861198b","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+The+Truth+About+Christmas+Carols+x264+AC3+5.1+%5BDD%5D+720p.m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"002c9d34300c278dd09fd567b7c996a58861198b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,44,157,52,48,12,39,141,208,159,213,103,183,201,150,165,136,97,25,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
