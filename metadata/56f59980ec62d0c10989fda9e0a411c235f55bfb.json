Miserable in his gray surroundings with stark fluorescent lighting, Joe dreams of being brave again. A visit to the doctor reveals that he has a &quot;brain cloud.&quot; It's fatal, but he'll be fine for a few more months. An eccentric millionaire, Samuel Harvey Graynamore (Lloyd Bridges), hears of Joe's predicament and comes to him with a proposal: The people of the Pacific island of Waponi Woo need a human sacrifice to appease their gods. Why not live like a king for a few weeks, then throw yourself into a volcano? (Graynamore needs a sacrificial victim to offer in exchange for permission to mine the island for a rare mineral.) Joe accepts Graynamore's lavish proposal and on his journey meets three romantic possibilities (all played by Ryan). Joe embraces life; so does the movie. It's packed with smile-inducing supporting performances by Bridges, Ossie Davis, Robert Stack, and Dan Hedaya; playful songs (&quot;Sixteen Tons,&quot; &quot;Ol' Man River,&quot; Presley's version of &quot;Blue Moon&quot;); and amusing scenes (such as Joe buying luggage).\n\n  Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Abe Vigoda.\n\n  Directed by: John Patrick.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 42min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f59980ec62d0c10989fda9e0a411c235f55bfb","amp;dn":"Joe+Versus+the+Volcano+%281990%29+%28Tom+Hanks%2C+Meg+Ryan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f59980ec62d0c10989fda9e0a411c235f55bfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,245,153,128,236,98,208,193,9,137,253,169,224,164,17,194,53,245,91,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
