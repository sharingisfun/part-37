Simply load your source \nfile and split away placing the cursor for start and stop positions as you listen\nto the content and select &quot;save&quot; to create separate mp3 files as needed, with your\nown setting for bitrate (192k is at present the default setting). \n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\n\nAugust 17th 2011\n\n \n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5bc78268b56a9c7e49c1bbcb18c27b602727181","amp;dn":"MP3+cutter+-+splitter+%28easiest+to+use%29+freeware+%28musicfromrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5bc78268b56a9c7e49c1bbcb18c27b602727181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,188,120,38,139,86,169,199,228,156,27,188,177,140,39,182,2,114,113,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
