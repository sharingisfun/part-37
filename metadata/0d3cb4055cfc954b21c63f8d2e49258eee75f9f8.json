It demands a freedom of view and greatness of thought so far unknown, indeed, not even dreamed of since Copernicus. It's a documentary. It's a story. It's mind-blowing special effects. This film plunges you into a world where quantum uncertainty is demonstrated - where neurological processes, and perceptual shifts are engaged and lived by its protagonist - where everything is alive, and reality is changed by every thought.\n\n*Interviews with scientists and authors, animated bits, and a storyline involving a deaf photographer are used in this docudrama to illustrate the link between quantum mechanics, neurobiology, human consciousness and day-to-day reality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d3cb4055cfc954b21c63f8d2e49258eee75f9f8","amp;dn":"What+the+bleep+do+we+know+-+down+the+rabbit+hole","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d3cb4055cfc954b21c63f8d2e49258eee75f9f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,60,180,5,92,252,149,75,33,198,63,141,46,73,37,142,238,117,249,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
