The women bring with them their most precious expectations about romance, love, fidelity, permanence, and tradition. Each bride who passes through has a story to tell - one that carried her there, to that dress, that room, that moment.\n\nIlluminating the poignant aspects of a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey to the altar, &quot;The Magic Room&quot; tells the stories of memorable women on the brink of commitment. Run by the same family for four generations, BeckerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s has witnessed transformations in how America views the institution of marriage: some of the shopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clientele are becoming stepmothers, some are older brides, some are pregnant. Shop owner Shelley has a special affection for all the brides, hoping their journeys will be easier than hers. Jeffrey Zaslow weaves their true stories using a reporterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research and a fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart.\n\nThe lessons Zaslow shares from within the Magic Room are at times joyful, at times heartbreaking, and always with insight on marriage, family, and the lessons that parents - especially mothers - pass on to their daughters about love. Weaving together secrets, memories, and family tales, The Magic Room explores the emotional lives of women in the twenty-first century.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41783f29badf339b1a00a775c3c3448e51fa3462","amp;dn":"The+Magic+Room+%28Jeffrey+Zaslow%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41783f29badf339b1a00a775c3c3448e51fa3462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,120,63,41,186,223,51,155,26,0,167,117,195,195,68,142,81,250,52,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
