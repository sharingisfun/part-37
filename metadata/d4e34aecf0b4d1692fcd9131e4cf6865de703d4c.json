And if you love Borges, it probably breaks your heart to see the limp and uninspired Andrew Hurley translations as the current English standard text of his work.\n\nFor those who don't know, Borges &amp; Giovanni collaborated on English translations of his stories to produce the author's preferred text. As part of this collaboration, Borges insisted Giovanni receive co-copyright (and therefore 50% of the profits) from any sales of these translations. The current executor of the Borges estate (his widow Kodama) does not approve of this arrangement, and has allowed the inarguably-best English translations of her late husband's work to fall out of print. \n\nThough it's a small victory, I look at (unauthorized) e-publishing as a means of balancing the scales. These are newly formatted e-texts of every Giovanni translation of the short stories of Borges I could find. Each has been proofed and linked with an active Table of Contents for easy reading. That said, if you find any errors, do let me know. Enjoy and seed!\n\n\n\nIncludes stories from:\n\n\nThe Aleph &amp; Other Stories\nA History of Infamy\nThe Book of Sand\nIn Praise of Darkness\nDoctor Brodie's Report\nLabyrinths\nThe Book of Imaginary Beings\n\n&amp; others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4e34aecf0b4d1692fcd9131e4cf6865de703d4c","amp;dn":"Short+Stories+of+Jorge+Luis+Borges+-+The+Giovanni+Translations+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4e34aecf0b4d1692fcd9131e4cf6865de703d4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,227,74,236,240,180,209,105,47,205,145,49,228,207,104,101,222,112,61,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
