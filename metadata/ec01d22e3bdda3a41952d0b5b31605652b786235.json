The usual caveat applies to this 'Restoration': some of you (depending on what you're viewing the file on) will need to reduce the image to a size closer to a comic book page in order to achieve the best image quality.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIssues 1-15 of 'Neil The Horse'\n\nAardvark-Vanaheim, 1983-1984\nRenegade Press, 1985-1988\n\nBy Arn Saba\n\nPublished by Aardvark-Vanaheim (Dave &amp; Deni Sim at the time) of Cerebus fame, and then by Renegade Press (the company Deni created when she and Dave split).\n\nNeil the Horse is a comic book character created by Canadian cartoonist Arn Saba (now Katherine Collins) in the mid 1970s. Neil is a happy, singing and dancing horse who likes bananas and milkshakes. Neil's adventures were syndicated in Canadian newspapers, published in a comic book series, and adapted for a radio musical.\n\nThe comic book series featured Neil and his friends Soapy and Mam'selle PoupÃƒÂ©e. All three of the characters sing, dance, and play music. The more developed comics stories primarily revolve around the trio's attempts to attain show-business success. While existing as a fantasy with nostalgic style, Neil the Horse also pays tribute to the era it was made (the 1980s). A typical issue included a story in prose with illustrations, a few short comic strips, and a longer comic-strip adventure. As the motto of Neil the Horse was &quot;Making the World Safe for Musical Comedy&quot; all issues also included original sheet music for the songs sung by the characters in the course of their adventures.\n\nNeil is a happy go-lucky (and not too bright) horse with a mania for bananas. In some issues he breakdances in urban streets to the accompaniment of a boombox.\n\nMam'selle PoupÃƒÂ©e is a hopeless romantic living doll from France. PoupÃƒÂ©e's body is jointed like a Barbie figurine. With the red circles on her cheeks, curly hair, large bust and thin waistline, the French-accented PoupÃƒÂ©e appears to be a cross between Raggedy Ann and Dolly Parton. She wears headbands and works out ÃƒÂ  la Olivia Newton-John.\n\nSoapy is street-wise and cynical (with a heart of gold), a cigar-smoker and a drinker, who serves as their manager and the brains of the operation.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec01d22e3bdda3a41952d0b5b31605652b786235","amp;dn":"Neil+The+Horse+%28Underground+-+Restored%29+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec01d22e3bdda3a41952d0b5b31605652b786235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,1,210,46,59,221,163,164,25,82,208,181,179,22,5,101,43,120,98,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
