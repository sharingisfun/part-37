These step-by-step instructions take existing HTML markup and add style, animation, and responsive navigation. This combination allows for dynamic one-page sitesâ€”a popular design that's now even faster and easier to create with PostCSS. Along the way, Ray Villalobos introduces some handy plugins, tips for integrating PostCSS into a Gulp-based workflow, and techniques for making layouts more responsive with Flexbox.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tStructuring the HTML markup for a single-page design\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing PreCSS Sass-like imports in PostCSS\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating Sass-like variables with PreCSS\r\n\tâ€¢\tBuilding styles\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating a layout for the header and navigation with Flexbox\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating and styling sections\r\n\tâ€¢\tAnimating page elements with PostCSS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11081e9184b01d93f43d6594857b8b0c2fc7dc03","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Building+a+Responsive+Single-Page+Design+with+PostCSS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11081e9184b01d93f43d6594857b8b0c2fc7dc03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,8,30,145,132,176,29,147,244,61,101,148,133,123,139,12,47,199,220,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
