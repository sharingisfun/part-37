Featuring six never-before-published pieces, Lore SegalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunning new book evolved from seven short stories that originally appeared in the New Yorker (including the O. Henry PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Reverse BugÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nIlka Weisz has accepted a teaching position at the Concordance Institute, a think tank in Connecticut, reluctantly leaving her New York circle of friends. After the comedy of her struggle to meet new people, Ilka comes to embrace, and be embraced by, a new set of acquaintances, including the instituteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s director, Leslie Shakespeare, and his wife, Eliza. Through a series of memorable dinner parties, picnics, and Sunday brunches, Segal evokes the subtle drama and humor of the outsiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loneliness, the comfort and charm of familiar companionship, the bliss of being in love, and the strangeness of our behavior in the face of other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deaths.\n\nA magnificent and deeply moving work, ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kitchen marks the longÃ¢â‚¬â€œawaited return of a writer at the height of her powers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efc59ea69cf9044ccdda8924fbd813e13d2d761c","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Kitchen-+Stories+by+Lore+Segal+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efc59ea69cf9044ccdda8924fbd813e13d2d761c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,197,158,166,156,249,4,76,205,218,137,36,251,216,19,225,61,45,118,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
