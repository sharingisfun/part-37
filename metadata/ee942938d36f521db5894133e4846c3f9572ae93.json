Crystal clear soundboard (although some sources mention this may be sourced from radio).\nEither way it sounds like an official release so if you don't have it, don't wait! This is Radiohead in the middle of their \n2003 tour and this show is really moving and inspired. Actually I still have no opionion on the new album, it's too new to\nreally have a judgement on it. But Radiohead have always been a source of surprises for me. So, looking forward for the new\ntour, here is some vintage stuff (kind of...).\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee942938d36f521db5894133e4846c3f9572ae93","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+2003-08-13+-+Tweeter+Center+in+Mansfield%2C+MA++SBD-AU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee942938d36f521db5894133e4846c3f9572ae93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,148,41,56,211,111,82,29,181,137,65,51,228,132,108,63,149,114,174,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
