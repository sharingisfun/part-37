Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside RileyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.\n\nDirector: Pete Docter\n\nActors: Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Mindy Kaling, Lewis Black, Phyllis Smith\n\nGenre: Comedy, Family","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6bc96a0a5cd92bcfe3c777727c88268adba9007","amp;dn":"Inside+Out.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%233+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6bc96a0a5cd92bcfe3c777727c88268adba9007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,188,150,160,165,205,146,188,254,60,119,119,39,200,130,104,173,186,144,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
