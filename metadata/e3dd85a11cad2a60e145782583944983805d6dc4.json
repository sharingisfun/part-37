It uses an a cappella version of rapper Jay-Z's The Black Album and couples it with instrumentals created from a multitude of unauthorized samples from The Beatles' LP The Beatles, more commonly known as The White Album. The Grey Album gained notoriety due to the response by EMI in attempting to halt its distribution, despite the fact that Jay-Z, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr expressed their approval of the project.\n\nAll songs sampled are by The Beatles unless otherwise noted.\n\nNo.\tTitle\tSong(s) sampled\tLength\t\n\n1.\t&quot;Public Service Announcement&quot; / &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot; 2:45\n\n2.\t&quot;What More Can I Say&quot; / &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; / &quot;Top Billin'&quot; \n         by Audio Two 4:25\n\n3.\t&quot;Encore&quot; / &quot;Glass Onion&quot; / &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; 2:40\n\n4.\t&quot;December 4th&quot; / &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; 3:34\n\n5.\t&quot;99 Problems&quot; / &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; 4:06\n\n6.\t&quot;Dirt Off Your Shoulder&quot; / &quot;Julia&quot; 3:59\n\n7.\t&quot;Moment of Clarity&quot; / &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot;\t4:00\n\n8.\t&quot;Change Clothes&quot; / &quot;Piggies&quot; / &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;\t4:04\n\n9.\t&quot;Allure&quot; / &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; 4:06\n\n10.\t&quot;Justify My Thug&quot; / &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; 4:12\n\n11.\t&quot;Lucifer 9 (Interlude)&quot; / &quot;Revolution 9&quot; / &quot;I'm So Tired&quot; 2:01\n\n12.\t&quot;My 1st Song&quot; / &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot; / &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot;, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; 4:44\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3dd85a11cad2a60e145782583944983805d6dc4","amp;dn":"Jay-Z+x+The+Beatles+-+The+Grey+Album+%5BRare%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3dd85a11cad2a60e145782583944983805d6dc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,221,133,161,28,173,42,96,225,69,120,37,131,148,73,131,128,93,109,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
