Keyboardist and vocalist Amy Foote levels the playing field when contrasted against IngersollÃƒâ€ s rich voice. ÃƒÂ´IÃƒâ€ d Rather Feel SmallÃƒÂ¶ is a blue grass-inspired track that drags the listener through swampy guitars. The up-tempo keys act like a floatation device and keeps your head above the murky depths.\n\nTechies across the land can rejoice as ÃƒÂ´Cyber MeÃƒÂ¶ comes buffering in with robotic feel because of the bass groove, yet IngersollÃƒâ€ s voice remains static and strong. In contrast to the previous two pieces, ÃƒÂ´Woods Are Full Of AnimalsÃƒÂ¶ is a rage-filled narrative with ghastly opera-styled harmonies, and keys; itÃƒâ€ s like a fairytale gone horribly wrong.\n\nThe minimalistic song, ÃƒÂ´LifeÃƒâ€ s Not Too Short,ÃƒÂ¶ features elegant guitar and Ingersoll sounding like heÃƒâ€ s just speaking his mind. Even when FooteÃƒâ€ s vocal section comes in, it isnÃƒâ€ t whining gibberish but well-sung lyrics that fits with Ingersoll like a glove. The finale, ÃƒÂ´Impression: Flood,ÃƒÂ¶ is a number that sweeps the listener off their feet, and although itÃƒâ€ s the shortest track, it stuck with me longer than the others did.\n\nLike The Blood is an interesting collection of songs that will either satisfy or disappoint, with this release there is a very thin middle ground. At best, even if youÃƒâ€ re not an avid fan of folk, one can appreciate the skillful songwriting featured on the release.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. I'd Rather Feel Small  (04:18), 10.00 MB\n02.
