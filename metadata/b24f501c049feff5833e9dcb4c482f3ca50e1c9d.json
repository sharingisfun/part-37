Now, with the 1.7.2\nrelease, Control4 has removed polling functionality from Director. Each time\nthe Dimmer light level changes, the system is automatically notified. This\nimproves graphical navigator tracking of light levels and linked keypad LED\ntracking.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A new security driver for the GE Networx NX8-587E virtual keypad interface\n(added to the Online Database for drivers).\nAdditional changes made in conjunction with the 1.7.2 release include:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Updated firmware for the Control4 Dock for iPod to resolve a problem where\ncertain network packets could cause the dock to lock up (purple LED). After\nthe Control4 system is updated, the dock should automatically update to\nfirmware build 00.03.18. Please note that an iPod must be present in the\ndock in order to report the correct firmware version.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Added a device-specific programming command to the Control4 Dock for iPod\ndriver which allows the LED on the dock to be turned on/off using\nprogramming. Please note that the LED will automatically turn on when the\nIdentify button is pressed.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Resolved various other defects reported by users of the Control4 Dock for\niPod.\nVersion 1.7.2 Release Notes Page 2\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Support for the Lua for Windows debugger has been added to the\nDriverWorks SDK. Developers can now set breakpoints, step through their\ncode, and enjoy the benefits of an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE)\nwhile creating and enhancing their DriverWorks drivers. Please see the 1.7.2\nversion of the DriverWorks SDK for additional information. Lua for Windows\ncan be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ In conjunction with the support for the new Control4 Wireless ELV Dimmer,\non all Control4 Dimmers you now have the ability to configure a load profile.\nWhile the load profile settings are primarily intended for the Wireless ELV\nDimmer, they also work on the standard Dimmer. Specifically, you can use\nMinimum On Level (%) for Dimmers that have a dimmable fluorescent (or\nCFL) load. This changes the dimming range so that the 0-100% seen by the\nuser starts at the Minimum On Level %.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Resolved problem where the 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Touch Screen buttons would stop working if\nthe Touch Screen was rebooted or lost and regained its network connection\nwhile the system was still running.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Resolved problem where phantom audio zones would remain displayed on the\nZones page of a Touch Screen if a network message wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t received.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Resolved a problem with the zone feedback from an HAI OmniPro security\npanel incorrectly displaying off by 1.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Resolved a problem whereby using Composer HE or Composer ProÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s device\ncontrol for a Control4 Thermostat would set the mode to Off.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Enabled photo Screen Saver for Home Controller HC-200, HC-300, and HC-\n500 operating in PAL display mode.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Resolved problem which prevented IP Cameras from being hidden or reordered\nusing Composer.\nThe 1.7.2 Release is a complete system software release. All Control4 devices have\nnew software. The update process will require that all devices in the entire Control4\nsystem be updated.\nTo implement the changes to remove polling functionality, Control4 Dimmers and\nSwitches will be updated with new firmware (01.21.62). You should plan on 3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5\nminutes per Dimmer/Switch for firmware updates. All ZigBee device firmware\nversions are listed in the firmware table in these Release Notes.\nAll new installations and updates from prior versions will default to 1.7.2.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b24f501c049feff5833e9dcb4c482f3ca50e1c9d","amp;dn":"Composer+Pro+1.7.2.160","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b24f501c049feff5833e9dcb4c482f3ca50e1c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,79,80,28,4,159,239,245,131,62,157,203,76,72,47,60,165,14,28,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
