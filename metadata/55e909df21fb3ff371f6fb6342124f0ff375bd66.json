The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tenth full-length album is their first release of new material with Merge since 1999Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s highly acclaimed 69 Love Songs.\n\nAfter putting out three synthesizer-free albums, The Magnetic Fields are returning to the signature mix of synth and acoustic sounds they established in the 90s with Merge releases such as The Charm of the Highway Strip and Get Lost. Stephin Merritt has come back to synths with a fresh approach: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Most of the synthesizers on the record didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist when we were last using synthesizers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he notes. The songs Ã¢â‚¬â€ none over three minutes long Ã¢â‚¬â€ were recorded in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York with MerrittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s usual cast of collaborators: Claudia Gonson, Sam Davol, John Woo, Shirley Simms, Johny Blood and Daniel Handler.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55e909df21fb3ff371f6fb6342124f0ff375bd66","amp;dn":"The+Magnetic+Fields...Love+at+the+Bottom+of+the+Sea%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55e909df21fb3ff371f6fb6342124f0ff375bd66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,233,9,223,33,251,63,243,113,246,251,99,66,18,79,15,243,117,189,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
