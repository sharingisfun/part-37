They recorded from 1963 through 1975, and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. Their emotive vocal stylings were sometimes dubbed &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot;.\nMedley and Hatfield both possessed exceptional vocal talent, with range, control and tone that helped them create a strong and distinctive duet sound and also to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his deep, soulful bass-baritone, with Hatfield taking the higher register vocals with his soaring tenor.\nThey adopted their name in 1962 while performing together in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called The Paramours which featured John Wimber, one of the founders of the Vineyard Movement, on keyboards. At the end of one particular performance, a black Marine in the audience shouted, &quot;That was righteous, brothers!&quot;prompting the pair to adopt the name when they embarked on a career as a duo.\n                                         (text from wikipedia)\n\n1- You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' \n2- Unchained Melody\n3- Little Latin Lupe Lu\n4- (I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons \n5- (You're My) Soul And Inspiration\n6- Ebb Tide  \n7- Go Ahead And Cry \n8- He  \n9- Hold On I'm Comin' \n10- Hung On You \n11- I Believe\n12- In The Midnight Hour\n13- Island In The Sun \n14- Just Once In My Life\n15- On This Side Of Goodbye \n16- Save The Last Dance For Me\n17- See That Girl\n18- Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n19- You'll Never Walk Alone\n20- the white cliffs of dover\n\n     320 kbs Thank you for seeding :o)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://vodpod.com/watch/62054-the-righteous-brothers-youve-lost-that-loving-feeling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://vodpod.com/watch/62054-the-righteous-brothers-youve-lost-that-loving-feeling&lt;/a&gt;                     \n\n            more great music in this link\n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/only1joe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/only1joe/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a6048a18503adb0bed023694721b293bbd67ff0","amp;dn":"Righteous+Brothers+-+Rock+n+Roll+Legends-Best+Of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a6048a18503adb0bed023694721b293bbd67ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,96,72,161,133,3,173,176,190,208,35,105,71,33,178,147,187,214,127,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
