Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works, incorporating more diverse and innovative styles in their music.\nBy the early 1980s, Queen was one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world.\nIn 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have sometimes performed together, including a collaboration with Paul Rodgers.\nThe band has sold over 150 million albums, with some estimates in excess of 300 million albums, making Queen one of the world's best-selling music artists. \nThey were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.queenonline.com/home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.queenonline.com/home&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n[from Wikipedia]\n\nCheck the INFO file for more details about this torrent\nand....\ndon't make me plead, please seed!\n\n- THOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nI have the body of a god.
