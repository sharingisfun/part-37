There was no english audio attached so we opted to sync the very nice LiNE audio from\nthe TS release to the video. According to wiki, Brazil's DVD region code is R4, hence why we tagged this as an R4 DVDRip\nVideo isn't the best either but it's better than what's out already, we'll do a better quality rip when proper retail/\nbluray hits. But for now we were bored and figured we'd just put this one out there. Standard work was done on the video, kept\nthe original res of the source instead of upscaling it. We resampled the audio, stretched, changed the tempo a tad then muxed and\nsynced the audio. Call it what you want, take it or leave it, we don't care, we only did it out of sheer boredom. Just go into this\nexpecting a low quality DVDRip and you'll be fine. Don't go off the screenshots, go off the sample for quality. You're free to try\nand do better if you want, we welcome you to do so. Peace.  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6k7o1g8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6k7o1g8.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/z2NyVY6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/z2NyVY6.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qsD3pGn.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qsD3pGn.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5MzoqJW.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5MzoqJW.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZOk3x9O.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZOk3x9O.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dMHOavJ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dMHOavJ.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04763907f3f505b3f2ccf220bc7610489a02177","amp;dn":"Rio+2+2014+READNFO+R4+DVDRip+LiNE+XviD-HELLRAZ0R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04763907f3f505b3f2ccf220bc7610489a02177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,71,99,144,127,63,80,91,63,44,207,34,11,199,97,4,137,160,33,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
