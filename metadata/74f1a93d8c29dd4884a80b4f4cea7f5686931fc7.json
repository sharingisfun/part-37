The story examines the life of United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.\n\nThe film was directed by John Sturges, with stars Louis Calhern, Ann Harding, Eduard Franz, and Philip Ober. Calhern created the role of Oliver Wendell Holmes in the play's original Broadway production, and the part was his only starring role in a sound film. A grateful MGM purchased the film rights of the play specifically as a reward to Calhern for playing secondary roles for the studio for years.\n\nThe film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Louis Calhern) and Best Costume Design, Black-and-White.\n\nA Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of the same title was broadcast in 1965 starring Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne.\n\nCast and characters\n\nLouis Calhern Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\nAnn Harding Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fanny Bowditch Holmes\nPhilip Ober Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mr. Owen Wister\nIan Wolfe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mr. Adams\nEduard Franz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Judge Louis Brandeis\nEdith Evanson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Annie Gough\nJimmy Lydon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Clinton\nRichard Anderson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reynolds\nHerbert Anderson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Baxter\nRobert Griffin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Court Crier\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74f1a93d8c29dd4884a80b4f4cea7f5686931fc7","amp;dn":"The+Magnificent+Yankee+%281950%29+Justice+Oliver+Wendell+Holmes+Bio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74f1a93d8c29dd4884a80b4f4cea7f5686931fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,241,169,61,140,41,221,72,132,168,11,79,76,234,127,86,134,147,31,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
