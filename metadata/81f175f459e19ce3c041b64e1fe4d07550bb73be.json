I am in the process of obtaining and sharing them all. I will also continue to collect as more soundtracks are released.\nI previously listed there being twelve, but I recently discovered they are German releases of radio plays. I don't think I'll be obtaining those in the near future...my German is nonexistent.\n\nSurprise! This has got to be one of the weirdest pieces of work I've come across. I cannot find any information about this album other than what physical copy I have in my hands. It's official with the copyright and everything on it, but the artists aren't any of whom we've heard of before, not even the live recording. All it says on the front of &quot;Music Inspired by the Movie&quot;.\nQuite honestly, I'm not all that impressed, but I haven't listened to the entire album, yet. I'd rather listen to Songs from Fairytopia, but I know there might be one person out there who enjoys it, so here it is in all its lossless glory!\n\nBarbie Fairytopia: Magic of the Rainbow\nTrack Listing:\n1.The Magic of the Rainbow\n2. It's Nasty Being a Toad\n3. The Flight of Spring\n4. Could There Be Anything as Beautiful as Me?\n5. Learn Your Lessons\n6. The Magic of the Rainbow (Instrumental Mix)\n7. Luminessence (intentionally spelled wrong for some reason)\n8. You Are the Most\n9. I Must Be Strong\n10. The Flight of Spring (Reprise)\n\nEnjoy, everyone! A thank you would be wonderful. :D\n\n\n***\nI am missing these albums. If anyone has them and would like to help complete this collection, I would be greatly appreciative.\n\nGerman Radio Plays:\nFairytopia (das Orginal-HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rspiel Zum Film)\nMermaidia (das Orginal-HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rspiel Zum Film)\nMagic of Pegasus (Barbie &amp; d.Geheimnisv.Pegasus)\n12 Dancing Princesses (12 Prinzessinnen)\nIsland Princess (Prinzessin d.Tierinsel-HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rspiel)\nDiamond Castle (Diamantschloss Original HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rspiel Zum Film)\n\nWal*Mart Exclusive CD:\nThe Barbie Diaries\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81f175f459e19ce3c041b64e1fe4d07550bb73be","amp;dn":"Barbie+Movie+Soundtrack+%234%3A+Magic+of+the+Rainbow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81f175f459e19ce3c041b64e1fe4d07550bb73be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,241,117,244,89,225,156,227,192,65,182,78,31,228,208,117,80,187,115,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
