Algorithms run everything from search engines on the internet to satnavs and credit card data security - they even help us travel the world, find love and save lives.\r\n\r\nMathematician Professor Marcus du Sautoy demystifies the hidden world of algorithms. By showing us some of the algorithms most essential to our lives, he reveals where these 2,000-year-old problem solvers came from, how they work, what they have achieved and how they are now so advanced they can even programme themselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55fc8f68fe5aefae90372bfb6f6a7f9b61e107bd","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Rules+of+Modern+Living+Algorithms+EN+SUB+WEBRIP+%5BMPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55fc8f68fe5aefae90372bfb6f6a7f9b61e107bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,252,143,104,254,90,239,174,144,55,43,251,111,106,127,155,97,225,7,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
