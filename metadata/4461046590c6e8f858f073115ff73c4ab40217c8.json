The disk \nimage is an exact copy of a physical disk (floppy, CD-ROM, hard disk, USB, VHD disk, etc.) \nor a partition that preserves the original structure. With WinImage in place, you can recreate \nthe disk image on the hard drive or other media, view its content, extract image-based files, \nadd new files and directories, change the format, and defragment the image. All this and more \nis delivered in one intuitive user interface that enables imaging right out of the box.\n\nWinImage has many cool features!\n\n * Create a disk image from a removable drive (like USB drive), CD-ROM, floppy,\n * Extract file(s) from a disk image,\n * Create empty disk images,\n * Inject files and directories into an existing disk image,\n * Change a disk image format,\n * Defragment a disk image,\n * A powerful &quot;Batch assistant&quot; mode that lets you automate many operations,\n * And many more! \n\nNew for version 9.00\n\nWinImage can be used as portable software (without installation and registry modification),\nusing Xml preference options. Write FAT16 or Fat32 bootable image to a removable drive, after\nerasing, and rebuild partitition table.\n\netc. etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4461046590c6e8f858f073115ff73c4ab40217c8","amp;dn":"WinImage.9.00.Incl.Keygen-ONY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4461046590c6e8f858f073115ff73c4ab40217c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,97,4,101,144,198,232,248,88,240,115,17,95,247,60,74,180,2,23,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
