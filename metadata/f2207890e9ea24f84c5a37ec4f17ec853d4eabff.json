Therefore, they live a party-life in which they sleep with a different girl every day. However this changes when Jules starts to date Anna (Sylvia Hoeks) and Max falls in love with her. Can their bromance overcome this love triangle. Although the makers of this movie claim this movie is a romcom, it still has the same adolescent humour we are accustomed to with Steffen en Flip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2207890e9ea24f84c5a37ec4f17ec853d4eabff","amp;dn":"Bros+Before+Hos+%282013%29+BluRay+1080p+5.1CH+x264+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2207890e9ea24f84c5a37ec4f17ec853d4eabff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,32,120,144,233,234,36,248,76,90,55,236,79,23,236,133,61,78,171,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
