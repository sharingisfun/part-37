But instead, they created    \n         a monster. Today, these giant bees are on the loose,          \n         spreading northward and invading US cities. MonsterQuest      \n         examines how these killer bees attack with an unseen          \n         ferocity and discovers that the bees may be adapting to       \n          colder temperatures, making them an even greater threat.      \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n         Hybrid.
