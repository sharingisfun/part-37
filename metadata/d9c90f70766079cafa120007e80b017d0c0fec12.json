And in a matter of years, Luke and his silent partner - his twin brother Logan - established a trendy, booming downtown nightclub that rocks the doors off every night of the week.\n\nHowever, Club Destiny isn't all that it appears to be. Although there is a very legitimate nightclub that is open to the public, there is also a bigger secret hidden behind the locked doors. Club Destiny is a front for a very exclusive swinger's club. The membership list is long, even if the annual fee is more than some cars, but just because you can afford it, doesn't necessarily mean you'll get it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c90f70766079cafa120007e80b017d0c0fec12","amp;dn":"Nicole+Edwards+-+Club+Destiny+Series+%28Books+1+-+6.5%29+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c90f70766079cafa120007e80b017d0c0fec12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,201,15,112,118,96,121,202,250,18,0,7,232,11,1,125,12,15,236,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
