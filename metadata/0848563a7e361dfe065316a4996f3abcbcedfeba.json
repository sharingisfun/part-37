The bands first EP 'Translations' built the band a strong underground following and saw them tour win over an army of fans thanks to a healthy touring schedule. In 2013 the band will release their highly anticipated debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœVenomousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The new album sees the band placing an original twist on the classic Aussie Rock sound, the result being a slab of infectious, hard hitting songs set to make its mark on the worlds scene. Catch the band on tour around the country this March! For fans of: Karnivool, Grinspoon, Guns n Roses\n\n\n\n\nHave a listen, if you like it, BUY IT. These guys don't have a huge support base, every sale they make will make a big difference.
