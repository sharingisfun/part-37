There is also the chance the keygen may stop working next update too.\n\nAutopano Giga allows you to stitch 2, 20, or 2,000 images.\n\nNew interface: Autopano Giga 2.5 has a new look! Dark gray predominates, allowing you to enhance your images like never before. Changes have also been made in the user interface.\n\nMulti-platform, multi-lingual: Autopano Giga runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.

We had an algorithm that works well in several cases but not all \n  of them. So we decided to change totally on the internal solution to\n  360Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° blending.\n\n* Papywizard and Gigapan improvement\n\n* With the availability of XML generation in new head, the papywizard plugin needed some improvement.\n\nFixes :\n\n* 0001096: [Import plugins] VR Drive 2 XML support - resolved.\n\n* 0001124: [Image I/O] Canon 600D exif not well decoded - resolved.\n\n* 0001118: [Shell Integration] AutopanoShell crash - resolved.\n\n* 0001122: [Neurone ( optimisation )] Gigapan plugin broken -\n  resolved.\n\n* 0001121: [Cortex ( rendu )] 360 Generation broken - resolved.\n\n* 0001112: [Import plugins] Ligthroom plugin issue - resolved.\n\n* 0001086: [Cortex ( rendu )] Check this fusion exposure - closed.\n\n* 0001092: [Image I/O] exif for panotour - closed.\n\n* 0001091: [UI behavior] crop zone display - closed.\n\n* 0001062: [Import plugins] Lightroom plugin not installed - closed.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.5.8 or above\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0d7c740a0515f3eddcddd40d053674e96716cbe","amp;dn":"Autopano+Giga+v.+2.6.1+with+%5BK%5Drack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0d7c740a0515f3eddcddd40d053674e96716cbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,215,199,64,160,81,95,62,221,205,221,64,208,83,103,78,150,113,108,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
