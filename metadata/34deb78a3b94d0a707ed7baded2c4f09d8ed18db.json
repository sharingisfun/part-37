Thirty years ago, \n\nan elven prince led an expedition in search of a legendary \n\nmagic said to be more powerful than any in the world. Of all \n\nthose who set out on that ill-fated voyage, not one has ever \n\nreturned. Until now. The rescued elf carries a map covered \n\nwith mysterious symbolsÃ¢â‚¬â€œand Walker Boh, the last of the Druids, \n\nhas the skill to decipher them. But someone else understands \n\nthe mapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s significance: the Ilse Witch, a ruthless young woman \n\nwho wields a magic as potent as his own. She will stop at \n\nnothing to possess the mapÃ¢â‚¬â€œand the magic it leads to.\n\n========================================================\n\nAntrax:\n\n\nNow in Antrax, as the crew aboard the airship Jerle Shannara \n\nis attacked by evil forces, the DruidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© Bek Rowe and \n\nhis companions are pursued by the mysterious Ilse Witch. \n\nMeanwhile, Boh is alone, caught in a dark maze beneath the \n\nruined city of Castledown, stalked by a hungry, unseen enemy.\n\n========================================================\n\nMorgawr:\n\n\nThe Morgawr is a centuries-old sorcerer of unimaginable \n\nmight, who feeds upon the souls of his enemies. With a fleet \n\nof airships and a crew of walking dead men at his command, \n\nhe is in relentless pursuit of the Jerle Shannara. His goal \n\nis twofold: to find and control the fabled 'magic' of \n\nParkasia, and to destroy the Ilse Witch (his disciple) to \n\nkeep her from using the magic to destroy him.\n\nBut she has already paid a heavy price for her actions. \n\nWhen Walker Boh persuades the witch to use the Sword of \n\nShannara, she is exposed to its awesome power and forced\n\nto confront the truth of her horrifying deeds as the Ilse \n\nWitch, causing her to flee deep into her own mind. She has \n\nonly one protector: her brother Bek, who is determined to\n\nredeem her.\n\nHe does this, and they use their combined magic to destroy \n\nthe Morgawr. They go home to the Four Lands. But rather \n\nthan going home with Bek, Grianne Ohmsford will be going \n\nnow to Paranor, for Walker charged her with a very important \n\ntask before he died: she is to foster a new Druid order.\n\n========================================================\n\nEffloresce~TPB.\n\n========================================================\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34deb78a3b94d0a707ed7baded2c4f09d8ed18db","amp;dn":"The+Voyage+of+the+Jerle+Shannara+-+Terry+Brooks+%28epub+mobi+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34deb78a3b94d0a707ed7baded2c4f09d8ed18db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,222,183,138,59,148,208,167,7,237,123,173,237,44,79,9,216,237,24,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
