The group took the blues-rock sound of late-'60s acts like Cream, Blue Cheer, and Vanilla Fudge to its logical conclusion, slowing the tempo, accentuating the bass, and emphasizing screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies. If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition, Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction, and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t19310-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.81% CDDA &amp; 99.87% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Black Sabbath\n02.The Wizard\n03.N.I.B.\n04.War Pigs\n05.Paranoid.\n06.Planet Caravan\n07.Iron Man\n08.Sweet Leaf\n09.Children Of The Grave\n10.Lord Of This World\n11.Tomorrow's Dream\n12.Supernaut\n13.Changes\n14.Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\n15.Killing Yourself To Live\n16.Hole In The Sky\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Symptom Of The Universe\n02.Back Street Kids\n03.She's Gone\n04.Dirty Women\n05.Never Say Die\n06.Shock Wave\n07.Neon Knights\n08.Heaven And Hell\n09.The Mob Rules\n10.Falling Off The Edge Of The World\n11.The Dark/Zero The Hero\n12.TV Crimes\n13.Psycho Man\n14.Selling My Soul\n15.The Devil Cried\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f277bad0ce8e58ad39a6db8d9bd9d0bed34c847b","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282008%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f277bad0ce8e58ad39a6db8d9bd9d0bed34c847b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,119,186,208,206,142,88,173,57,166,219,141,155,217,208,190,211,76,132,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
