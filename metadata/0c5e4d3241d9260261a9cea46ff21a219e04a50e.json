She gained notoriety during the Prague Spring of 1968 with her song &quot;Modlitba pro Martu&quot; (A prayer for Marta). [no 12 on this CD]\n\nDuring the Prague Spring, she recorded over 200 SP records and one LP, Songy a Balady (1969), which was immediately banned from stores. In 1970, the government falsely accused her of making pornographic photographs leading to a ban from performing in Czechoslovakia until 1989. She was a signatory of Charter 77 proclamation. Her first LPs after the Velvet revolution in 1989 were a re-issue of Songy a Balady and a compilation of old songs, titled Lampa.\n\nThis CD is a recital with piano played by Petr Malasek in the Ungelt theatre in Prague.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5e4d3241d9260261a9cea46ff21a219e04a50e","amp;dn":"Marta+Kubisova+Czech+singer+-+V+Ungeltu+%5B1999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5e4d3241d9260261a9cea46ff21a219e04a50e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,94,77,50,65,217,38,2,97,169,206,164,111,242,26,33,158,4,165,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
