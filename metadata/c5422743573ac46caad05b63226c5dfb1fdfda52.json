The term &quot;new jack swing&quot; describes the sound produced and engineered by R&amp;B/Hip hop artist and producer Teddy Riley.  The new jack swing style developed as many previous music styles did, by combining elements of older styles with newer sensibilities. It used R&amp;B style vocals sung over hip hop and dance-pop style influenced instrumentation. The sound of new jack swing comes from the hip hop &quot;swing&quot; beats created by drum machine, and hardware samplers, which was popular during the golden age of hip hop, with contemporary R&amp;B style singing.\n\n\n               BOBBY BROWN - Don't Be Crual  (1988)\n               JOHNNY KEMP  - Just Got Paid  (1988)\n               BABYFACE  - It's No.Crime (1989)\n               KEITH SWEAT  - Make You Sweat  (1990)\n               PRINCE AND THE NEW POWER GENERATION - Gwtt Off  (1991)\n\n\n      &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; is a song performed by R&amp;B artist Bobby Brown.
