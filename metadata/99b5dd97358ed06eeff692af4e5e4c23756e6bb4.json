On record, the numerous lead singers make the show sound more like a folk \nfestival than a performance by one group, but this remains a spirited effort much in tune with the first Carnegie Hall show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b5dd97358ed06eeff692af4e5e4c23756e6bb4","amp;dn":"The+Weavers+Reunion+at+Carnegie+Hall+1963","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b5dd97358ed06eeff692af4e5e4c23756e6bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,181,221,151,53,142,208,110,239,246,146,175,78,94,76,35,117,110,107,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
