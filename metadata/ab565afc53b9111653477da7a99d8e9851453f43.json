The 18-song album sees Aguilera collaborate with a new range of producers and songwriters including Tricky Stewart, Polow da Don and Samuel Dixon who have each produced three songs for the album as well crossing over from several different musical styles including R&amp;B, pop, electropop, and synthpop.\n\nBionic is the singer's first studio album in four years since Back to Basics (2006) and was preceeded by lead single, &quot;Not Myself Tonight&quot; which reached top 40 in most countries. Upon release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised Aguilera for being daring and experiemental whilst others felt that she was heavily influenced by her collaborators which resulted in inconsistency. In the United States it debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 albums chart with sales of 110,000 copies, becoming her lowest charting album on the chart. Bionic made UK chart history by first debuting at number one with lowest number of copies sold in eight years and then by registering the largest weekly decline for a number one album.\n\n\nTracks:\n01.
