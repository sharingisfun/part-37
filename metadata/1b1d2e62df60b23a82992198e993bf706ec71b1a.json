The album became a major success in continental Europe, Scandinavia, and Canada, topping most of the album charts during the second half of 1978 and also became their first UK number one album. Nightflight to Venus includes their worldwide hits &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; and &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot;, a double A-sided single that topped the UK singles chart and sold close to 2 million copies there. The follow-up was another Boney M. classic, &quot;Rasputin&quot;, in most countries also a double A-side coupled with &quot;Painter Man&quot;, a cover of a 1966 hit by the band The Creation. In the UK, &quot;Rasputin&quot; and &quot;Painter Man&quot; were released separately as A-sides by Atlantic Records, both reaching the Top 10. Nightflight to Venus also became Boney M.'s most well received album in the United States, peaking at #134 on The Billboard 200. &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; which peaked at #30 on The Billboard Hot 100 became their biggest US hit.\n\nSide A\n&quot;Nightflight to Venus&quot; (Frank Farian, Fred Jay, Kawohl) - 4:46\n&quot;Rasputin&quot; (Frank Farian, Fred Jay, George Reyam (Hans-JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rg Mayer)) - 5:51\n&quot;Painter Man&quot; (Phillips, Pickett) - 3:10\n&quot;He Was a Steppenwolf&quot; (Frank Farian, Fred Jay, Stefan Klinkhammer) - 6:51\n&quot;King of the Road&quot; (Roger Miller) - 2:36\n\nSide B\n&quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; (Brent Dowe, Trevor McNaughton) - 4:18\n&quot;Voodoonight&quot; (Giorgio Sgarbi) - 3:31\n&quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot; (Traditional; arranged by Frank Farian) - 4:02\n&quot;Never Change Lovers in the Middle of the Night&quot; (Mats BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rklund, Keith Forsey, Fred Jay) - 5:32\n&quot;Heart of Gold&quot; (Neil Young) - 4:00\nAll songs in mp3 format.\n\nThanks for downloading and please please seed. -7Phoenix","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b1d2e62df60b23a82992198e993bf706ec71b1a","amp;dn":"Boney+M.+-+Nightflight+to+Venus+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b1d2e62df60b23a82992198e993bf706ec71b1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,29,46,98,223,96,178,58,130,153,33,152,233,147,191,112,110,199,27,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
