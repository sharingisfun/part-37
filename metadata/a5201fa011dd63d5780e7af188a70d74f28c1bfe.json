Twice a day on every planet you can opt in to a defensive battle and earn Supply Crates.\r\n*Edit Mode Improvements - We've improved base management!

This is the reason there are 2 MOD versions, to choose the desired one.\r\nTips:\r\n1) for Defensive missions, I suggest the &quot;ELITETURRETS MOD&quot;\r\n2) for Attack missions, I suggest the &quot;ELITETROOPS MOD&quot;\r\n3) it's usually all about troops/defenses count. It's better to have 50 weak units/turrets than 40 stronger ones if you use these MODs.\r\n\r\nRequires Android OS 4.0 and up also supports both tablets and phones","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5201fa011dd63d5780e7af188a70d74f28c1bfe","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%26trade%3B%3A+Commander+v3.6.0.6952+%2B+mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5201fa011dd63d5780e7af188a70d74f28c1bfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,32,31,160,17,221,99,213,120,14,122,241,136,167,13,116,242,140,27,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
