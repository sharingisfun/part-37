There wasn't even a reason for it: sometimes love just fades, as quickly and mysteriously as it appears in the first place. \n\nEnter Damien. Damien's the guy with a different man on his arm for every event, he's smooth and arrogant and always impeccably turned out. Christo hates him. But God, he's gorgeous. Damien could be exactly what Christo needs to get him over John. \n\nIt's only going to be a fling. Nothing serious, nothing that will affect their working relationship or the rest of their lives. So why are they fighting through the night rather than letting go and walking away? Why does Damien's secretive nature bug Christo so much? And why does he even care that the other man might not be as tough as he pretends to be?\n\nCONTENT WARNING: This book contains explicit scenes unsuitable for those under 18.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d853f60b19e8b05e38d7804c65de8f53a6c7960e","amp;dn":"What+He+Wants+-+Aaron+Kate+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d853f60b19e8b05e38d7804c65de8f53a6c7960e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,83,246,11,25,232,176,94,56,215,128,76,101,222,143,83,166,199,150,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
