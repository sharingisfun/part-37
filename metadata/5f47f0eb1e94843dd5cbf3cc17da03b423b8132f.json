Four years on from\nthe first edition, Wilhite has returned\nwith 15 selections by artists from\nDetroit, Chicago and New York.\n\n&quot;The compilation itself represents\nVibes and the people that represented\nthe store,&quot; Wilhite told Rush Hour.\n&quot;Each cut has the representation of who\nthe artist is and what he really likes\nto put out.&quot;\n\nThere are plenty of big names'\nMoodymann, Jovonn, K-Alexi, Orlando\nVoorn, DJ Stingray, Josh Milan of Blaze\nand Detroit techno group Los Hermanos\nall feature alongside lesser-known\nartists like Jon Easly.
