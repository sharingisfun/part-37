The &quot;Run Away&quot; Single-EP is the beginning of a series of single releases, which will be planned and put into effect during this year together and build up the prelude to an upcoming album.\n\nThe Watermarks offer pumping, driving Indie/Wave in a field of tension between British Sea Power and Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, with a pinch Bloc Party and a breeze of Secret Machines. The Mixture of Post-Punk, Brit-Pop and Electro-Rock can easily compete with notable bands out of this genres, without sounding like a copy.\n\n&quot;Find yourself stumbling upon a masterpiece that drives you to shake everyone you know until they wake up and see what they're missing...The \n\nWatermarks are definitely a band to be watched&quot; - undercontrol.org.uk\n\n&quot;Sounds like one of Tony WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Factory bands on steroids.&quot;\n- Consequence Of Sound\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nWATCH THE VIDEO FOR RUN AWAY HERE:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe music in this release is free... just like everything else we've done.
