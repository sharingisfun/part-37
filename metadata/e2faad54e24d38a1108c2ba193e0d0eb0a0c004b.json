I&amp;#039;ve given all the songs the correct ID3v1 and v2 tags and I&amp;#039;ve eliminated most of the applause on the music tracks. I&amp;#039;ve split the introduction sections off as well, giving each section with David Tennant talking is its own properly tagged MP3 Track (Including the Q&amp;A Section).\n\nI&amp;#039;ve split the concert up into 33 tracks for a total time of 1:28:00.\n\nThe tracks have been split along applauses and long silences. This way a greater selection of tracks are available, allowing you to skip from one section to another. All the tracks are of high quality and well cut. In some cases I&amp;#039;ve inserted silences in order to allow for it to run smoothly. All the tracks are formatted for easy listening on your computer or MP3 player. I hope you enjoy this rip.\n\nThe songs have been cut into files in the following manner:\n\nPrologue\nDrama FX\nTardis FX\nDr. Who Speaks\nRose Sequence (Action)\nRose Sequence (Melancholy)\nRose Sequence (Playful)\nMonster Mash Intro\nSlitheen Theme (Space And Monsters Sequence)\nLady Cassandra Theme (Space And Monsters Sequence)\nSpace and Monsters Sequence Part 3\nClockwork Men Theme (Space And Monsters Sequence)\nTooth and Claw Theme (Space And Monsters Sequence)\nNew Doctor Intro\nCrashed Tardis (Tenth Doctor Sequence)\nSycorax and UNIT Theme (Tenth Doctor Sequence)\nThe Doctor&amp;#039;s Sword Fight (Tenth Doctor Sequence)\nSoft Adventure Theme (Tenth Doctor Sequence)\nAction Adventure Theme (Tenth Doctor Sequence)\nRunaway Bride Intro\nChristmas Special 2006\nDr. Who Q&amp;As\nThe Daleks Part One\nCybermen Intro\nThe Cybermen\nFinale Intro\nThe Daleks Part Two\nDoomsday Intro\nDoomsday\nAlmost Over and Songs Intro\nLove Don&amp;#039;t Roam\nSong for Ten\nDoctor Who Theme\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2faad54e24d38a1108c2ba193e0d0eb0a0c004b","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+2006+Cardiff+Concert+-+A+Celebration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2faad54e24d38a1108c2ba193e0d0eb0a0c004b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,250,173,84,226,77,56,161,16,140,43,161,147,224,208,235,10,12,0,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
