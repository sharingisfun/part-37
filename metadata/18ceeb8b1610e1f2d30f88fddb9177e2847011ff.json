Dr. Lorraine Day, an internationally acclaimed orthopedic trauma surgeon and lecturer, operated on as many AIDS patients as any surgeon in the country. And like all trauma surgeons, she was covered with blood from patients' gun shot wounds, stab wounds and other massive injuries day after day, year after year, while being assured by the &quot;experts&quot; that her work was not hazardous. But here she explains how she suddenly discovered that these very &quot;experts&quot; were not telling the full truth about AIDS to the surgeons, to other medical personnel and especially to the public. Day reveals astonishing, well documented facts about the AIDS epidemic, facts that the government denies but facts that you must know to protect yourself and your family from this fatal disease. In this amazing book youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn: that the AIDS virus is not fragile; that the AIDS virus survives outside the body for days; why blood on intact skin is dangerous; that the blood banks could have improved the safety of the blood supply years before the AIDS test was available, but chose not to; why the blood supply still is not safe; what the government really thinks about the safety of condoms; the facts about the Florida dentist who gave AIDS to his patients; the risks from HIV positive children in schools, in day care centers and in contact sports; why kissing is not safe; the newest information about mosquitoes; what must be done to control the AIDS epidemic. 310 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18ceeb8b1610e1f2d30f88fddb9177e2847011ff","amp;dn":"Day-AIDS-What+Government+Isn%5C%27t+Telling+You%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18ceeb8b1610e1f2d30f88fddb9177e2847011ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,206,235,139,22,16,225,242,211,15,136,253,219,145,119,226,132,112,17,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
