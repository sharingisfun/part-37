The theological-scientific debate that ensues, and the wicked strategies that Roger employs to disembarrass Dale of his faith, form the substance of this novel - these and the current of erotic attraction that pulls Esther, Roger's much younger wife, away from him and into Dale's bed. The novel, a majestic allegory of faith and reason, ends also as a black comedy of revenge, for this is Roger's version - Roger Chillingworth's side of the triangle described by Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter - made new for a disbelieving age.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f919ea43f8c7d5b8417259deee79aecdf70ed4c3","amp;dn":"Roger%27s+Version+%28John+Updike%29+Retail+azw3+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f919ea43f8c7d5b8417259deee79aecdf70ed4c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,25,234,67,248,199,213,184,65,114,89,222,238,121,174,205,247,14,212,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
