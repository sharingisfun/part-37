The Wilson is an interesting design, it closely resembles the small commercial T&amp;CG machines you can buy, however it is a home made version.\n\nIts weighs 50 pounds, occupies just over 1 sq foot of bench space and has a 1/20hp motor. Includes an air spindle which operates on 15 PSI.\n\nWARNING - this is just an article about the grinder written by the author, if anyone is interested in the plans for this grinder, please comment on this page and I will try to upload them by Dec. 2012 (apologies in advance for the delay)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:477f9f96fcb2cb6a3e30bc51f11e68a3a4f25ab6","amp;dn":"Wilson+Tool+and+Cutter+Grinder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"477f9f96fcb2cb6a3e30bc51f11e68a3a4f25ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,127,159,150,252,178,203,106,62,48,188,81,241,30,104,163,164,242,90,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
