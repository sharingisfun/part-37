Unfortunately, Windows XP isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t supported. The browser comes with lots of new features such as improved download manager, the ability to pin websites to Windows 7 taskbar, add-on performance advisor, etc. IE users can upgrade the browser via Windows Update. Users who want to download the offline installer can get it from the direct download links in this post.\n\nLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s find out some improvements that has been made for Internet Explorer 9.\n\nImproved performance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Thanks to the improved rendering engines, the speed is perhaps the most noticeable part of IE 9. It may still not be the fastest one, however.\n\nUser interface ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The menus, icons and tools at the top of the browser in IE 8 has been removed in IE 9, offering a minimalist user interface. All of the old menu options can be accessed from a new main menu icon. Tabs have also been moved next to the address bar, but it can be optionally moved to below the address bar.\n\nIntegration with Windows 7 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users can pin websites to Windows 7 taskbar with IE 9, making it easier to access your favorite sites.\n\nSide-by-side Tab Viewing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ You can normally open multiple tabs in a single window with tabbed browsing, but in Internet Explorer 9 you can even view two tabs at once side by side.\n\n\nHow To Install:\n---------------\nDepending on your OS either x32/x64, navigate to the respective folder,\nthen open the prerequisites folder and install ALL the updates and then restart your PC. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU MUST INSTALL ALL THE PREREQUISITES RELEVANT TO YOUR OS EITHER 32 OR 64BIT.\n\nThen start either the IE9-Windows7-x86-enu if you are on Windows 7 32bit or \nIE9-Windows7-x64-enu if you are using the 64bit OS.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
