For that reason, the band's second effort isn't as consistently stunning as their debut, though overall it's a very successful continuation of the themes of their classic album. Besides the hit &quot;Strange Days,&quot; highlights included the funky &quot;Moonlight Drive,&quot; the eerie &quot;You're Lost Little Girl,&quot; and the jerkily rhythmic &quot;Love Me Two Times,&quot; which gave the band a small chart single. &quot;My Eyes Have Seen You&quot; and &quot;I Can't See Your Face In My Mind&quot; are minor but pleasing entries in the group's repertoire that share a subdued Eastern psychedelic air. The eleven-minute &quot;When the Music's Over&quot; would often be featured as a live showstopper, yet it also illustrated their tendency to occasionally slip into drawn-out bombast. -- Richie Unterberger \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Strange days [03:09] \n 02.You're lost little girl [03:03] \n 03.Love me two times [03:17] \n 04.Unhappy girl [02:00] \n 05.Horse latitudes [01:35] \n 06.Moonlight drive [03:04] \n 07.People are strange [02:12] \n 08.My eyes have seen you [02:30] \n 09.I can't see your face in [03:27] \n my mind \n 10.When the music's over [10:59] \n ____ \n \n 35:16 min \n 48,4 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08894d8d1018946bd54e935bab46a1a5635086e8","amp;dn":"The_Doors-Strange_Days-%28Retail%29-1967-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08894d8d1018946bd54e935bab46a1a5635086e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,137,77,141,16,24,148,107,213,78,147,91,171,70,161,165,99,80,134,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
