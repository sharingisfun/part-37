Balthazar, whose life parallels that of his first keeper, Marie, is truly a beast of burden, suffering the sins of man. But despite his powerlessness, he accepts his fate nobly. Through BressonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unconventional approach to composition, sound, and narrative, this seemingly simple story becomes a moving parable of purity and transcendence.\n\nFilm Essays - Au hasard Balthazar By James Quandt: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/370-au-hasard-balthazar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.criterion.com/current/posts/370-au-hasard-balthazar&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b113e41442fa53aade67c82526506e82e47c3630","amp;dn":"Au+Hasard+Balthazar+%281966%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29+Criterion+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b113e41442fa53aade67c82526506e82e47c3630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,19,228,20,66,250,83,170,222,103,200,37,38,80,110,130,228,124,54,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
