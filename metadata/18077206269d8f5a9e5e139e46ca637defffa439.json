He was part of a string band that recorded in the 20's and 30's. He is revered by many folk and rock stars,and one of them is Loudon Wainwright, III. Charlie Poole's band &quot;The Ramblers', was &quot;a bluesy fiddle lead, backed up by long, flowing, melodic guitar runs and the finger-style banjo picking of Poole. Predictable as it may be, it was nonetheless outstanding. No string band in early country music equalled the Ramblers' controlled, clean, well-patterned sound.&quot; He played mostly cover songs, but he wrote many songs, words and music. Charlie Poole left a legacy that many remember, and Loudon Wainwright III has honored him by singing many of his songs\n\nDisc 1\n\n&quot;High Wide &amp; Handsome&quot; (Loudon Wainwright III), 2:53 \n&quot;Took My Gal out Walkin'&quot; (Unknown), 2:34 \n&quot;I'm the Man Who Rode the Mule Around the World&quot; (Traditional), 3:35 \n&quot;My Mother and My Sweetheart&quot; (E.P.

Many of the tunes are written by Charlie Poole, but Loudon has inserted several of his own songs. Wainwright's children, Rufus and Martha, join in on several tunes to make this a CD that you want to listen to over and over again. Charlie Poole was from North Carolina, and he always wanted to leave this world 'High Wide and Handsome'. That is an old southern expression that you called someone of wealth and importance. \n\nSome of these tunes make no sense at all' I'm The Man Who Rode The Mule Around The World' is one that many have tried to understand and finally left alone. 'My Mother and My Sweetheart' is a tune that memorializes two women that are loved by a man, such sweet and lovely lyrics. 'Goodbye Booze' seems to be a favorite of all. Charlie Poole was a boozer and after a thirteen week drunk he died at the age of 38. The sentimental 'Mother's Farewell Kiss' is one of those songs where you sing along. 'Where the Whippoorwill Is Whispering Goodnight' is one of the old time tunes that brings back the times of Charlie Poole. 'The Man In The Moon'-is sung by Martha Wainwright and is about anyman, but seems too fit Charlie Poole. 'Moving Day' a song of non-payment for a flat seems to be full of Poole's life. This tune was the first song of Poole's that Wainwright heard, and he felt an instant karma. 'Old and Only In The Way' is a popular title of songs and is a song of the times in the 20's and 30's. 'Sweet Sunny South' has the old time banjo sound of Poole, written about his hometown. 'Rowena' is a song of Loudon Wainwright's mother, and dedicated to her.. 'Ramblin's Blues' gives Charlie Poole's band, 'The Ramblers' a first class ride. 'Charlie's Last Song'- a tribute to Charlie Poole. And, the CD finishes with a reprise of 'High, Wide and Handsome'-that's how I like livin' he said. \n\nThis is CD that reveres the memory of Charlie Poole, his truth, honesty and humor are there for all to see. Loudon Wainwright, III sings and plays his part. As the 'Rolling Stone' said, &quot;Loudon Wainwright III, sings clever harmonies to songs about marriage, booze and rabble-rousing. Dude seems to know this subject matter very well!&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18077206269d8f5a9e5e139e46ca637defffa439","amp;dn":"Loudon+Wainwright+III...High+Wide+%26+Handsome%3B+The+Charlie+Poole+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18077206269d8f5a9e5e139e46ca637defffa439","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,7,114,6,38,157,143,90,158,94,19,158,70,202,99,125,239,255,164,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
