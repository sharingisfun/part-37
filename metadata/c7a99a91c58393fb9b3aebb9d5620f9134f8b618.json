Founded in 1956, it is published by Reed Business Information Ltd, a subsidiary of Reed Elsevier. The company Albert E. Reed acquired New Scientist when it merged with IPC Magazines in 1970, retaining the magazine when it sold most of its consumer magazines in a management buyout to what is now IPC Media.\nThe magazine covers current developments, news, and commentary from the scientific community, including environmental issues such as climate change. It also prints speculative articles, ranging from the technical to the philosophical. There is a readers' letters section which discusses recent articles, and discussion on the website.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7a99a91c58393fb9b3aebb9d5620f9134f8b618","amp;dn":"New+Scientist+-+August+6th+2011+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7a99a91c58393fb9b3aebb9d5620f9134f8b618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,169,154,145,197,131,147,251,155,58,235,185,213,98,15,145,52,248,182,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
