The original members were Anders &amp; Jonas BjÃƒÂ¶rler, Peter Dolving, Adrian Erlandsson and Patrik Jensen. Both of the BjÃƒÂ¶rler brothers and Erlandsson were members of the seminal melodic death metal band At the Gates, a pioneering force in the Swedish death metal scene.\n\nA minority of members, past and present, are from Gothenburg, Sweden; with the exception of Patrik Jensen, who is from LinkÃƒÂ¶ping; Per MÃƒÂ¶ller Jensen, who is from Denmark; Adrian Erlandsson, who is from MalmÃƒÂ¶; and Marco Aro, who is from Finland.Replacements, Eye of the Storm &amp; Exit Wounds\n\nPatrik Jensen and Jonas BjÃƒÂ¶rler had a discussion at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband, and when Jensen asked J.BjÃƒÂ¶rler as to who should be the new vocalist in the band, J.BjÃƒÂ¶rler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days after, Jensen phoned Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and tempted to rejoin but at first was hesitant due hectic touring he had done with the band in the past, which Aro was not interested in doing, but The Haunted had done it for almost a decade straight after Aro left, getting all the touring out of them. More hesitation came when Aro struggled with drug addiction back then and with him to be back in the band again, he didn't want it to reoccur as it had also given him problems within his family, which he felt he had to talk to before rejoining. Aro is also in the band The Resistance and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have a discussion with The Resistance as well. Aro had told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which interested Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated there was good news coming from the band. His picture was in a silhouette on the band's official Facebook the day before the band announced a new line-up. Adrian Erlandsson, a former member, returned to the band also and Ola Englund from Six Feet Under was brought in as the band's new lead guitarist. The band then began writing for an EP titled Eye of the Storm which was released on 20 January 2014 in Europe and 21 January 2014 in North America. The band had also been rehearsing before the announcement of the new lineup to perform for the first time live with this lineup at the 70000 Tons of Metal which sat sail 27-31 January 2014.\n\nOn 1 July 2014, it was annouced that their new album would be titled Exit Wounds, with the release date of 25 August 2014 in Europe and 2 September 2014 in North America. The track listing and the album cover were revealed on the same day as well.\n01. 317\n02. Cutting Teeth\n03. My Salvation\n04. Psychonaut\n05. Eye Of The Storm\n06. Trend Killer\n07.
