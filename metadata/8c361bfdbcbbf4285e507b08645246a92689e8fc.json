Now, many years later, Jeremiah Covenant, the last sane sibling, lies on his deathbed knowing his fragile existence is the only thing restraining the curse. His only hope is Patrick Galloway, a fellow soldier from the Great War and a specialist in abolishing evil abominations.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Clive Barkerâ€™s Undying, a horrifying FPS romp of curses, strange, mad creatures, and family dysfunction gone terribly wrong. Step into the shoes of Patrick Galloway as you attempt to banish the evil using your arcane magic and the ever-dependable six shooter of metal grace. Pray to whatever god you believe in because this journey may end up costing your soul. First person shooter meets the contemporary master of horror fiction, don't miss it!\r\n\r\n\r\nWage a holy war against things that should not be: relentless Jemaas Warriors, pack-hunting prowlers, and the mind-twisting Inhabitants of Oneiros.\r\n\r\nRichly detailed environments that truly showcase the Covenant estate and its two parallel universes.\r\n\r\nCollect an explosive arsenal, including the Tibetan War Cannon, the always dependable double barrel shotgun, and the Scythe of the Celt.\r\n\r\nPowerful black magic at your fingertips!
