It is promoted and organised by national radio station Triple J. In previous years, the host town was selected in the form of a competition where residents of the town must gain approval from local government and a venue. For the 2009 event, Triple J itself simply decided to host the event in Sale. Triple J arranges the artists to perform Ã¢â‚¬â€œ usually four high profile Australian bands of a variety of genres.\nThe concert is a drug and alcohol free event, and entry is free.\n\nThe 2013 concert was hosted in the North-Western NSW town of Dubbo on April 13th.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a1076e9bc265e4de5eb9f17fd1f78e56d42fd9a","amp;dn":"triple+j%27s+One+Night+Stand+2013.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a1076e9bc265e4de5eb9f17fd1f78e56d42fd9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,16,118,233,188,38,94,77,229,235,159,23,253,31,120,229,109,66,253,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
