Knowledge of the enemy?s dispositions can only be\nobtained from other men.? ?Sun Tzu, The Art of War\nOur story begins 2000 years ago with the words of Sun Tzu, a Chinese general and a man who\nvalued information and those who brought it to him. The informant is an institution as old\nas history. Controversial for nearly as long, the informant?s role in law enforcement is as\nimportant today as it was in Sun Tzu?s day. One might suppose that, at a time when science has\ngiven the police more tools than ever before to use in the war on crime, we would not need to\nrely so much on the informant. Unfortunately, Sun Tzu was right in saying that knowledge of\nthe enemy?s dispositions can only be obtained from other people.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50261fb9bd1ca06a493410889019dd7a6acc8876","amp;dn":"CONFIDENTIAL+INFORMANT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50261fb9bd1ca06a493410889019dd7a6acc8876","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,38,31,185,189,28,160,106,73,52,16,136,144,25,221,122,106,204,136,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
