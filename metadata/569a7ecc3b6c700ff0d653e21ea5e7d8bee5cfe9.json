For some reason my last one was garbage.\n\nWhen a Mapuche chief suddenly goes missing, a British naturalist is asked to find him in the vast Argentine pampas\n\nClarke, a nineteenth-century English naturalist, roams the pampas in search of that most elusive and rare animal: the Legibrerian hare, whose defining quality seems to be its ability to fly. The local Indians, pointing skyward, report recent sightings of the hare but then ask Clarke to help them search for their missing chief as well. On further investigation Clarke finds more than meets the eye:in the Mapuche and Voroga languages every word has at least two meanings.Witty, very ironic, and with all the usual Airian digressive magic, The Hare offers subtle reflections on love, Victorian-era colonialism, and the many ambiguities of language.\n\n\nIf you don't have it, please download this and tell me if it works this time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569a7ecc3b6c700ff0d653e21ea5e7d8bee5cfe9","amp;dn":"The+Hare+%28reupload%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569a7ecc3b6c700ff0d653e21ea5e7d8bee5cfe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,154,126,204,59,108,112,15,240,214,83,226,30,165,231,216,190,229,207,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
