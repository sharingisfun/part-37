Alongside &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot;, the song was released to U.S. radio stations on October 8, 2008.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; was directed by Jake Nava, whom Knowles had worked with on her previous videos. In a black and white tone, Knowles is performing as her alter ego Sasha Fierce. It shows her in asymmetrical leotard and high-heels, with two other female dancers. The video is choreography-driven, with routines that encompasses hip-and-leg shaking, and heels clicking, &quot;almost as if they&amp;#039;re tap dancing, to give the song some extra beats&quot;. Towards the end of the video, Knowles flashes her wedding ring that is almost camouflaging with her cyborg arm.\n\nKnowles premiered the music video, along side the video for &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot;, on MTV&amp;#039;s Total Request Live show. The video was released to major outlets on October 13, 2008. Upon the video&amp;#039;s release, many internet bloggers noticed similarities between &quot;Single Ladies&quot; and &quot;Mexican Breakfast&quot; in terms of choreography. The latterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½choreographed by Broadway legend, Bob FosseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½became an internet viral sensation when Unk&amp;#039;s &quot;Walk It Out&quot; was dubbed over the original mix. While promoting the song on BET&amp;#039;s 106 &amp; Park, Knowles stated that she was inspired by the video after viewing it on YouTube and wanted to see if she could attempt it. Another video by Knowles, &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot;, was inspired by Fosse&amp;#039;s musical Sweet Charity.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:139b48a230e19e932eacc93d8b12a3a9c52b21f0","amp;dn":"Beyonce+-+Single+Ladies+%28Put+A+Ring+On+It%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"139b48a230e19e932eacc93d8b12a3a9c52b21f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,155,72,162,48,225,158,147,46,172,201,61,139,18,163,169,197,43,33,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
