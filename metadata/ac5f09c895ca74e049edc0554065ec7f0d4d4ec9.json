This is Zork I thru IV and Beyond Zork. All brought to you by GOG so it is DRM FREE. Included with the games are several fun items.\n\nJust mount the image to a virtual drive and run the .exe file.\n\nAs per usual you will need a DOS emulator to play these games. Yes I suggest DOSbox ( believe it or not I do not work for them lol) \n\nYou may find the latest version here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nI suggest you download and install DOSbox first then install this game.\n\nEnjoy\n\nNCHermit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac5f09c895ca74e049edc0554065ec7f0d4d4ec9","amp;dn":"Zork+Anthology+%5BNCHermit%5D.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac5f09c895ca74e049edc0554065ec7f0d4d4ec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,95,9,200,149,202,116,224,73,237,192,85,64,101,236,127,13,77,78,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
