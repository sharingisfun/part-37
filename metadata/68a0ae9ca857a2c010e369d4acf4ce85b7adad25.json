In his Big Thinkinglecture at Congress 2012, he argues that the liberal classÃ¢â‚¬â€the press, universities, liberal religious institutions, labour unions and the Democratic PartyÃ¢â‚¬â€have forsaken their core values and sold out to corporate interests.\n\nChris Hedges was a foreign correspondent for nearly two decades for The New York Times, The Dallas Morning News, The Christian Science Monitorand National Public Radio, and the author of such books as War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning (2002), American Fascists (2007), I Don't Believe in Atheists (2008) and Empire of Illusion(2009). He is a senior fellow at The Nation Institute and has taught at Columbia University, New York University and Princeton University.\n\nFor decades the liberal class was a defense against the worst excesses of power. But the pillars of the liberal classÃ¢â‚¬â€ the press, universities, the labor movement, the Democratic Party, and liberal religious institutionsÃ¢â‚¬â€have collapsed. In its absence, the poor, the working class, and even the middle class no longer have a champion.\n\nIn this searing polemic Chris Hedges indicts liberal institutions, including his former employer, the New York Times, who have distorted their basic beliefs in order to support unfettered capitalism, the national security state, globalization, and staggering income inequalities. Hedges argues that the death of the liberal class created a profound vacuum at the heart of American political life. And now speculators, war profiteers, and demagoguesÃ¢â‚¬â€ from militias to the Tea PartyÃ¢â‚¬â€are filling the void","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68a0ae9ca857a2c010e369d4acf4ce85b7adad25","amp;dn":"Chris+Hedges+-+Death+of+the+Liberal+Class","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68a0ae9ca857a2c010e369d4acf4ce85b7adad25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,160,174,156,168,87,162,192,16,227,105,212,172,244,206,133,183,173,173,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
