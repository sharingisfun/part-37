For dark enchantments still await him. There is murderous discord between Amber and Chaos to be silenced. And a captive royal father, long believed dead, must first be freed from a villain's magic before a beleaguered Prince can deem his triumph complete","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ff15f88616326a4876a02174220ad6f74037a46","amp;dn":"Roger+Zelazny+-+Prince+of+Chaos+%28The+Chronicles+of+Amber+%2310%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ff15f88616326a4876a02174220ad6f74037a46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,241,95,136,97,99,38,164,135,106,2,23,66,32,173,111,116,3,122,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
