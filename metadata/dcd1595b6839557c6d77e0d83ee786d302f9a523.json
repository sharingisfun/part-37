Some heroes were given new names, such as: Gravestone (formerly Fantom of the Fair, Fantom or Fantoman), Nightmask (Masked Marvel), Thresher (aka Shark), and Midnight Blue (formerly Blue Lady). In the case of Gravestone, the name was changed to avoid confusion with Lee Falk's Phantom (although there were a few instances when the hero was referred to as &quot;Fantom&quot; within the pages of the first few issues). Nightmask was changed from Masked Marvel to avoid any potential legal problems with Marvel Comics (both explanations appeared in the letter column page of the first issue of The Protectors). Many of Centaur's heroes received updated costumes but retained their original names, including Zardi The Eternal Man, Amazing Man, Mighty Man, Man of War, Iron Skull, Mantoka, Arrow, Witch and Airman, along with the villains The Great Question and Conqueror.&quot;\n\nso enjoy another blast from the past.  Please seed so others may enjoy since my bandwidth is so limited.\n\nand last but not least, thanks goes to you BlackCanary for giving me the idea to UL these wonderful books!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcd1595b6839557c6d77e0d83ee786d302f9a523","amp;dn":"Centuar+comics+superhero+collection%21+Golden+age+comics%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcd1595b6839557c6d77e0d83ee786d302f9a523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,209,89,91,104,57,85,124,109,119,224,216,62,231,134,211,2,249,165,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
