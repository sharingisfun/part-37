With a mix of strict arrangements, solid songwriting and an open mind towards the unknown, the sometimes-frayed free jazz is made more accessible, even for the not so consecrated jazz audience. Dag Magnus Narvesen mainly composes the music, but the band also writes song collectively. Sasquatch finds their inspiration primarily in the progressive jazz, with references to Archie Shepp, Ornette Coleman, Atomic and Albert Ayer. Sasquatch has toured around in Scandinavia, Estonia, England and played festivals like Molde jazz, Oslo jazz, DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸la jazz, Aberdeen Jazz festival and Tudengi jazz.
