It&amp;#039;s real difficult to find these days, but it&amp;#039;s one of the very best garageoriented compilations of the era, and a pretty diverse one. There&amp;#039;s hot White soul from the Rationals, a rare single by the Amboy Dukes, fetchingly raw folkrock from the Human Beinzs and the Underdogs, burning garage punk from the Unrelated Segments, and even a castrato Four Seasons imitation by Tim Tam the TurnOns. The heart of the collection, however, are the five early, preElektra sides by the MC5, which are garage rock at its most metallic and furious, and the Dylanesque mid&amp;#039;60s hard rock sides by Bob Seger, a good decade before he broke nationally. The sound is excellent, as are the liner notes; it&amp;#039;s worth paying collector prices for.\n- Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90824b514b8a13c2e2fc07a4d8d6e8e5dc9a60f5","amp;dn":"Michigan+Nuggets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90824b514b8a13c2e2fc07a4d8d6e8e5dc9a60f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,130,75,81,75,138,19,194,226,252,7,164,216,214,232,229,220,154,96,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
