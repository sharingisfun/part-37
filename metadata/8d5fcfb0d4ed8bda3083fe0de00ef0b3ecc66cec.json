The increase in number of humans and in our individual and collective power has exponentially intensified our impact on the health of ecosystems, an impact that has consequences to our own health. Effective policies to deal with these threats depend upon scientific understanding of the complex interactions between humans, the natural environment and our public health. This book provides the background necessary to pursue these policies and to develop the additional understanding and information needed for the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d5fcfb0d4ed8bda3083fe0de00ef0b3ecc66cec","amp;dn":"Ecosystem+Change+and+Public+Health%3A+A+Global+Perspective","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d5fcfb0d4ed8bda3083fe0de00ef0b3ecc66cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,95,207,176,212,237,139,218,48,131,254,13,224,14,240,179,236,198,108,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
