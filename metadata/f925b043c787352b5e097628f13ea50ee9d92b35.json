If you don't know what to do, do not download the file.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe plot of American Nightmare is framed by the narration of an episode of the fictional TV show, &quot;Night Springs,&quot; which follows the style of The Twilight Zone and appeared on television screens throughout the original Alan Wake.\n\nAlan Wake's friend and manager, Barry, is asleep in a motel room. The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the &quot;herald of darkness&quot;, Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppleganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the &quot;champion of light,&quot; has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.\n\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with a satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.\n\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f925b043c787352b5e097628f13ea50ee9d92b35","amp;dn":"Alan+Wake+American+Nightmare+XBLA+GOODKLAAT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f925b043c787352b5e097628f13ea50ee9d92b35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,37,176,67,199,135,53,43,94,9,118,40,241,62,165,14,233,217,43,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
