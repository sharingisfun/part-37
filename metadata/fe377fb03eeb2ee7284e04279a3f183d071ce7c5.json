Drummer Matt Taul was called away from the studio during the sessions for the birth of his daughter, so session drummer Adam Turgeon filled in on some tracks. The last song on the album, &quot;Cling&quot; is actually a home demo that Meeks recorded on a four-track machine. The entire album is acoustic, with emphasis on guitar, and features weak melodies such as &quot;Face of the Earth&quot; and &quot;Freak&quot; as well as more upbeat songs like &quot;The Down Town&quot; and &quot;Where I Stand.&quot;\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic. HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Shelf in the room                                    [04:44]\n02.Touch, peel and stand                                [04:58]\n03.Face of the earth                                    [05:17]\n04.Solitude                                             [04:12]\n05.The down town                                        [04:17]\n06.What's left for me                                   [05:27]\n07.Freak                                                [05:24]\n08.Now                                                  [05:05]\n09.Whimsical                                            [06:02]\n10.Where I stand                                        [05:39]\n11.How do you know you                                  [05:34]\n12.Cling                                                [15:28]\n________\n72:07 min\n115,0 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
