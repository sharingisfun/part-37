It was first released on 22 August 1914, eighteen days after the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, and regular issues continued throughout World War I. The magazine was discontinued after the 8 February 1919 issue, but returned 16 September 1939 following the start of World War II. 255 issues were published over the course of the Second World War before the magazine permanently ceased production on 11 April 1947.
