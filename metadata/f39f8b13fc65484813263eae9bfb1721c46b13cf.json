The French audio production\nrates a comparison and is quite interesting indeed, I submit to you!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096028/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096028/&lt;/a&gt;\n(A scathing rebuke of classic Indian culture by an movie Indian producer)\n\nSalaam Bombay (1988) is a wake-up call to the harsh realities on the ground \nin respect of cultural make-up of life in India at the present time.\n\nIt would be insane to consider integrating what is shown in this movie with any \nrespect of European civilization as a compatible or remotely possibly \nco-existent model in any regard whatsoever.\n\nTo each his own as they say, and that is most certainly the case here.\n\nThis is from a PAL DVD9 that contained the original Hindi language audio along\nwith a French audio track as well. It also contained French subtitles only.\n\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves the possibility that any in our midst envision\nwhat is shown in this movie as something we want to become equal to in any\nnotions of propriety whatsoever. The &quot;monkey dance&quot; done by Steve Balmer at Microsoft on one occasion is shown equally by a neanderthal genius in this\nmovie who takes it upon himself to swing a belt buckle at at boy carrying some\ntea to see if this would entertain the visiting gal (from Australia?) no thanks!\n(to this brand of entertainment genius and social modelling insanity!)
