Spanning over three decades, their repertoire has \nincluded such diverse genres as pop, disco, jazz, bebop, blues, soul, funk, dance, country and rock.\n\nThe group had its early origins when sisters June and Bonnie Pointer began performing in clubs in \n1969 as &quot;Pointers, a Pair&quot;. The line-up grew to a trio when sister Anita Pointer joined them. They \nscored a record deal with Atlantic Records and released several unsuccessful singles. The trio grew \nto a quartet when sister Ruth joined in December 1972. They then signed with Blue Thumb Records, \nrecorded their debut album, and began seeing more success. The group achieved its greatest commercial \nsuccess as a trio during the 1980s consisting of the line-up of June, Ruth, and Anita. Bonnie had \nleft the group in 1978 to commence a solo career with only modest success.\n\n\n   1. The Pointer Sisters - Yes We Can Can                    [06:05]\n   2.
