Their style has been characterised as progressive rock, although their sound often explored other genres, incorporating elements of styles such as folk, psychedelia, acid, jazz fusion and rock and roll. The band achieved recognition in the United Kingdom through their albums, club and concert tours and appearances at festivals, but were unable to attract the same level of attention in USA.\n\nThe band's rotating membership throughout its relatively short existence led to a diversity in sound throughout their different albums. Family are also often seen as an unjustly forgotten act, when compared with other bands from the same period and have been described as an &quot;odd band loved by a small but rabid group of fans&quot;.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnyway is the fourth album from the British progressive rock band Family. Side one was recorded at a concert at Fairfield Halls in the Croydon section of London; side two was a collection of studio recordings.\n\nAnyway was a stopgap album between A Song for Me and Fearless, evenly divided between a concert side and a studio side. The record was originally meant to be a double live album, but the band felt the available recordings weren't up to par; the Fairfield Halls performances were meant to satisfy fans who wanted an example of their concert work on disc. Apart from a studio recording of &quot;Strange Band&quot; issued on an EP, none of the songs performed live, in fact, had ever been released in any form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50eb4b2f04da87ac4a7ae53cd11bbf7f393019ac","amp;dn":"Family+-+Anyway+%5B1970%5D%5B2013%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50eb4b2f04da87ac4a7ae53cd11bbf7f393019ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,235,75,47,4,218,135,172,74,122,229,60,209,27,191,127,57,48,25,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
