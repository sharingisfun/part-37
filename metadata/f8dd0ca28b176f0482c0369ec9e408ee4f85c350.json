Chang was a Red Guard briefly at the age of fourteen, then worked as a peasant, a &quot;barefoot doctor,&quot; a steelworker, and an electrician. As the story of each generation unfolds, Chang captures in gripping, moving Ã¢â‚¬â€ and ultimately uplifting Ã¢â‚¬â€ detail the cycles of violent drama visited on her own family and millions of others caught in the whirlwind of history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8dd0ca28b176f0482c0369ec9e408ee4f85c350","amp;dn":"Wild+Swans%3A+Three+Daughters+of+China+by+Jung+Chang+%28Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8dd0ca28b176f0482c0369ec9e408ee4f85c350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,221,12,162,139,23,111,4,130,192,54,158,201,228,8,238,79,133,195,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
