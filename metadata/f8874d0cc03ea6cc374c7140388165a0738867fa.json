Defining death is difficult since it often involves ideas of a soul or a spiritual entity which is believed to live on in various metaphysical realms. However, the universal aspect which characterises death is the corpse. The absence of life is physical, material and real; it is a dead body. It is this primary materiality of death which triggers human responses to the inevitable, and all funerals, in one way or another, solve the problem of the decaying corpse. The contributors to this book discuss and explore alternative ways of dealing with burials.\n\nThis is a collection of 16 papers presented from an EAA session held at Krakow in 2006, exploring various aspects of the archaeology of death.\n\nContents:\n\nThe Materiality of Death: Bodies, Burials, Beliefs \nFredrik Fahlander &amp; Terje Oestigaard\n\nMore than Metaphor: Approaching the Human Cadaver in Archaeology\nLiv Nilsson Stutz\n\nA Piece of the Mesolithic.
