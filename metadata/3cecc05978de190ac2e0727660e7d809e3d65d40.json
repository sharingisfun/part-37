Channel 4 is broadcasting\nlive and exclusively from Leicester in three special programmes presented by\nJon Snow with Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Arthur Williams and Sonali Shah. This first\nprogramme captures the climax of the procession of the king's mortal remains to\nthe site of his death at Bosworth Battlefield, through the streets of Leicester\nand to the service that marks his reception into Leicester Cathedral, with a\nsermon given by the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent\nNichols. Channel 4 assembles leading historians, actors and politicians,\ndescendants of the king and key participants in his rediscovery, to ask who\nRichard really was and what his place in British history should now be. On\nThursday morning, Channel 4 returns to Leicester Cathedral for exclusive live\ncoverage of the reburial.
