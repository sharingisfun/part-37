But he refuses so he is locked up. He escapes and is pursued. Eventually they run into some Indians and there's a gunfight. Carter seeks refuge in a cave. While there he encounters someone who is holding some kind of medallion. When Carter touches it, he finds himself in a place where he can leap incredible heights, among other things. He later encounters beings he has never seen before. Later he meets a woman who helps him to discover that he is on Mars. And he learns there's some kind of unrest going on. \n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23e372ddcfb798159c477c6b54246925fc856ad5","amp;dn":"John+Carter+%28+Nordic+%2F+Multi+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23e372ddcfb798159c477c6b54246925fc856ad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,227,114,221,207,183,152,21,156,71,124,107,84,36,105,37,252,133,106,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
