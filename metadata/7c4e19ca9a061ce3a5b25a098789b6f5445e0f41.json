This is season 1, which is considered the best one with the original cast.  Sadly, the quality of this rip is horrible.  Its equivalent to 2nd or 3rd generation VHS (complete with bad tracking static), but it is all there.  I will continue to seed this until Rysher puts out a DVD edition that we can buy and support the studio with.  Such a shame that this great show must go on unknown to the world.  The files are saved in MP4 ipod quality format, so dont expect anything stellar there either.  As I said, the quality is awful, but its just a stopgap (hopefully) until better quality stuff is officially released.  Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c4e19ca9a061ce3a5b25a098789b6f5445e0f41","amp;dn":"Special+Ops+Force%2C+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c4e19ca9a061ce3a5b25a098789b6f5445e0f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,78,25,202,154,6,28,227,165,178,90,9,135,137,182,245,68,94,15,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
