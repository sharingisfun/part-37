With the impending departure of star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen to free agency, Beane attempts to devise a strategy for assembling a competitive team for 2002 but struggles to overcome Oakland's limited player payroll. During a visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess players' value. Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted him, Beane having been a Major League player before becoming general manager. Though scouts considered Beane a phenomenal player, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. After some prodding, Brand admits that he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and that Beane would probably have gone to college instead. Sensing opportunity, Beane hires Brand as the Athletics' assistant general manager.\n\n::GENERAL::\n\nComplete name: Moneyball 2011 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 2333.45 MiB\nDuration: 2h 13mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 448 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-12-23 06:21:06\nSubtitles: English,Romanian\nEncoded by Vice\n\n::VIDEO SPECIFICATION::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 116 r2074 2641b9e\nAverage video bitrate: 2000\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nResolution: 1280x696\nSource: Moneyball 2011 iNTERNAL 720p BluRay x264 AVS720 Thanks\n\n::AUDIO SPECIFICATION::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 448kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nChannel positions Front:L C R, Rear:L R, LFE\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/57125935794544365049.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/57125935794544365049.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/36157736381860583374.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/36157736381860583374.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/29805724582504305965.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/29805724582504305965.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/87035254729702810569.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/87035254729702810569.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n::Info Hash:: 8FD3DA16F5404224552DD8DBA55F12BB06B0D027","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd3da16f5404224552dd8dba55f12bb06b0d027","amp;dn":"Moneyball+2011+720p+BRRip+x264+vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd3da16f5404224552dd8dba55f12bb06b0d027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,211,218,22,245,64,66,36,85,45,216,219,165,95,18,187,6,176,208,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
