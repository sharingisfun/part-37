His improvising is unique and immediately recognizable; he's synthesized the styles of klezmer clarinetists and New Orleans jazz great Sidney Bechet, frequently employing glissandi and a heavy vibrato. Moreover, Krakauer performs fiercely, almost primitively; the way he spits notes reminds me of the playing of a shofar (ram's horn) player. Krakauer, impressive though he is, can be criticized for his indifference to pacing and construction. He doesn't seem to conceive of a solo as a whole, doesn't connect his phrases or build particularly well and, considering the variety of musical forms he's familiar with, employs a relatively limited vocabulary","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c641d48e0befb2944a68fa07aa3cc8f8a0293dc1","amp;dn":"David+Krakauer+-+A+New+Hot+One+%282001%29+%5BJazz+Klezmer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c641d48e0befb2944a68fa07aa3cc8f8a0293dc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,65,212,142,11,239,178,148,74,104,250,7,170,60,200,248,160,41,61,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
