It also stars the wonderfully hilarious Charles Coburn as Ameche's grandfather.\n\nA well written, well acted and well directed film that is unjustly underrated and should be rediscovered. The entire film is shot in gorgeous full Technicolor and handled by director Ernst Lubitsch capable hands.\n\nIt details the story of a man, played by Ameche, who thinks that he deserves to go to hell after he dies. He then proceeds to recount his life story to the devil (Laird Cregar). A true delight that is not to be missed.
