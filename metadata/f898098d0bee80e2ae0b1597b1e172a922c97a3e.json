With Folders Factory, you can easily change their colour, add pictures, include text, assign textures or even make them look like &quot;embossed&quot; system folders.\n\nDoing this will improve your performance and your systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appearance. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll no longer have to read folder names as you can now easily identify the one you need.\n\nThe application is very user-friendly. All you have to do is: drag the image you want into the applicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s window, configure the way it looks, and then drag the folder you want to modify there too. Done.\n\nTips:\n- To reposition an object, move your pointer over the object, and then drag the pointer.\n- To rotate an object, put your pointer outside any corner of the bounding outline around the object and drag.\n\nWhat's New in Version 1.7\n\n- Added OS X sandbox support.\n- Added Chinese localization.\n- Fixed issue with shadow.\n\nRequirements: Mac OS X 10.6 or later\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f898098d0bee80e2ae0b1597b1e172a922c97a3e","amp;dn":"Folders+Factory+1.7+%28Mac+App+Store%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f898098d0bee80e2ae0b1597b1e172a922c97a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,152,9,141,11,238,128,226,174,11,21,151,177,225,114,169,34,201,122,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
