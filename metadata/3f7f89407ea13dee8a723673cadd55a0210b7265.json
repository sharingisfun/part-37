Jointly presented by Juita Viden and Golden Screen Cinemas (GSC), it is the first period kungfu comedy to be produced locally in Malaysia and Singapore, with famed action choreographer from Hong Kong, Yuk-Sing Ma, who have worked on Hong Kong and China\\'s blockbusters, such as Storm Riders 2 and A Chinese Fairy Tale.\n\nThe story took two years of research work and preparation. The production of the film took place earlier than Namewee\\'s Nasi Lemak 2.0, but as Nasi Lemak 2.0 was released earlier, Petaling Street Warriors thus has become the second full-length movie Namewee would star in 2011.[7]\n\nAfter viewing the film as it underwent post-production work in Hong Kong, numerous Hong Kong filmmakers call the film as the \\&quot;watershed\\&quot; and \\&quot;milestone\\&quot; in the history of Malaysian Chinese film industry.\n\nPetaling Street Warriors would be released in cinemas nationwide in Malaysia (December 1, 2011) and Singapore (December 29, 2011). Cinema chains that will be playing the film in Malaysia include GSC, TGV, Cathay, Big, LFS, MBO, Star, First World, Mega Prai and also Brunei Mall. In Singapore, the film will be shown via Shaw, Cathay, Eng Wah, Filmgarde Cineplex and Golden Village\\'s circuits.\n\nIts gala premieres have been held at 9:30pm on 25 November 2011 at GSC Pavilion KL, Malaysia, and at 8:45pm on 19 December 2011 at Shaw Theatres LIDO, Singapore. Although its official showing date in Singapore is January 5, its sneak preview screenings has started since December 23.\n\nSince opening on 1 December, its first 4-day box office collection (RM1.4 million) has surpassed that of Nasi Lemak 2.0 (RM 1 million). It was also the highest-grossing Chinese film in the week it was first shown.\n\nThe movie is also available in original and dubbed-in-Malay versions on Astro First between January 12 and February 15, 2012\n\nResolution - 640x480\nBitrate - 2200\nFPS - 25\nCodec - Mp4\nSound Codec - AAC - VBR 152kbps(max)\nLanguage - Cantonese\nSubtitle - Hardsub English\n\nPS:i rip this myself,Enjoy! ^^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f7f89407ea13dee8a723673cadd55a0210b7265","amp;dn":"Petaling+Street+Warrior+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f7f89407ea13dee8a723673cadd55a0210b7265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,127,137,64,126,161,61,238,138,114,54,115,202,221,85,160,33,11,114,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
