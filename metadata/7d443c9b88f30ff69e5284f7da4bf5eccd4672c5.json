His music is often elaborate and complex in nature. He is best known for his hit 1973 album Tubular Bells, which broke new ground as an instrumental album and launched Virgin Records, and for his 1983 hit single &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;. He is also well known for his hit rendition of the Christmas piece, &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot;.\nOldfield's parents are Maureen and Raymond Oldfield, a nurse and general practitioner. His sister Sally and brother Terry are successful musicians in their own right and have appeared on several of his albums. Mike Oldfield was born in the Battle Hospital, Reading, Berkshire and he attended St Joseph's Convent School, Highlands Junior School in Tilehurst, St Edward's Preparatory School  and Presentation College in Reading. When he was 13 he moved with his parents to Harold Wood where he attended Hornchurch Grammar School. He only stayed there long enough to take one GCE examination, in English, as he had already begun his music career. \n\nOldfield's career began fairly early, playing acoustic guitar in local folk clubs. At this time, he already had two fifteen-minute instrumental pieces in which he would &quot;go through all sorts of moods&quot;, a precursor to his landmark 1970s compositions. In his early teens, Oldfield was involved in a 'beat group' playing Shadows-style music (he has often cited Hank Marvin as a major influence, and would later cover The Shadows' song &quot;Wonderful Land&quot;). In 1967 he and his sister Sally formed the folk duo The Sallyangie and were signed to Transatlantic Records after exposure in the local folk scene. An album, Children of the Sun, was issued in 1968. After Sallyangie disbanded, he formed another duo with his brother Terry, called Barefoot, which took him back to rock music. \nIn 1970 he joined ex-Soft Machine vocalist Kevin Ayers' backing group The Whole World playing bass guitar. The band also included keyboardist and composer David Bedford, who quickly befriended Oldfield and encouraged him in his composition of an early version of Tubular Bells. Bedford would later arrange and conduct an orchestral version of that album. Oldfield is featured on two Ayers albums, Whatevershebringswesing and Shooting at the Moon. Both albums featured early versions of what would become Oldfield's trademark sound.\nHaving recorded a demo version of Tubular Bells, Oldfield attempted to convince someone in the music industry to take the project on, but was told it was unmarketable. However, in 1972 he met the young Richard Branson who was setting up his own record label, Virgin Records, and after playing the demo to engineers Tom Newman and Simon Heyworth, he began recording the 1973 version of the album.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d443c9b88f30ff69e5284f7da4bf5eccd4672c5","amp;dn":"Mike+Oldfield+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d443c9b88f30ff69e5284f7da4bf5eccd4672c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,68,60,155,136,243,15,246,158,82,132,247,218,75,245,236,205,70,114,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
