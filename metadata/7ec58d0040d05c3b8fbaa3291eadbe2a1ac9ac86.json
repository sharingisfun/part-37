By the date of its release, Alabama 3 will have survived 3 record deals, 3 elections, 2 wars and 2 recessions. During that time they have struggled as HOSTAGES to the FORTUNE of BIG LABELS. The 8th Alabama 3 album will be the first taste of sweet release on their new INDEPENDENT label, HOSTAGE records, recorded at their new studio at JAMM in the heart of Brixton\n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\n01 Oh Christ\n02 She Blessed Me (Feat.
