This is outright disturbing.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnderstanding the Muslim Mindset:\nFormer Islamic Terrorist Walid Shoebat and grandson of a Muslim Mukhtar (chieftain), has converted and is now conducting conducting worlwide lectures, giving rate insight into the mind of a Jihadist. Author of the bestselling books including &quot;Why we want to kill you,&quot; Walid, wanting to make up for lost time, is making amends for his past life and on a mission to warn the world of the depth of indoctrination many Muslims go through for their entire life, with all roads pointing to Jihad, or holy war against the 'infidels,' a.k.a. Jews and Christians. In this video, &quot;Understanding the Muslim Mindset,&quot; the viewer will learn hundreds of nuggets of information they probably never before saw discussed on major network TV or read in any newspapers. It's strong, but necessary information. Forewarned is forearmed.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBible Prophecy and the Coming Muslim anti-Christ:\nThe Christian Bible and Christian Bible Prophecy predict that in the end times the Antichrist, a beast, an dreaded evil man, more evil than any who ever walked the earth in history, will be thrust upon the world scene, and that billions of people on planet earth will die between natural cataclysms and those killed by the Antichrist--including gruesome beheadings for those who refuse to bow to his religious-government system.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecember 9 2013 Breaking News Agenda 21 United Nations New World Order Last Days News:\nDecember 9 2013 Breaking News Country Sovereignty VS United Nations Agenda 21 New World Order Last Days Final Hour News Prophecy Update\n\nThe United Nations and the Future of Global Governance http://www.cfr.org/international-organizations-and-alliances/united-nations-future-global-governance/p29122\n\nRevitalizing Global Governance: The Next Steps in the Process http://uncsd.iisd.org/guest-articles/revitalizing-global-governance-the-next-steps-in-the-process/\n\nOklahoma Tea Party Leader Al Gerhart Charged After Agenda 21 Threats http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/10/oklahoma-tea-party_n_3052696.html\n\nNew Hampshire Lawmaker, Says United Nations.

The decision to hold the conference was made by UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/236 on 24 December 2009. It was intended to be a high-level conference, including heads of state and government or other representatives and resulting in a focused political document designed to shape global environmental policy.\n\nAgenda 21 is a 300-page document divided into 40 chapters that have been grouped into 4 sections:\n\nSection I: Social and Economic Dimensions is directed toward combatting poverty, especially in developing countries, changing consumption patterns, promoting health, achieving a more sustainable population, and sustainable settlement in decision making.\n\nSection II: Conservation and Management of Resources for Development Includes atmospheric protection, combating deforestation, protecting fragile environments, conservation of biological diversity (biodiversity), control of pollution and the management of biotechnology, and radioactive wastes.\n\nSection III: Strengthening the Role of Major Groups includes the roles of children and youth, women, NGOs, local authorities, business and industry, and workers; and strengthening the role of indigenous peoples, their communities, and farmers.\n\nSection IV: Means of Implementation: implementation includes science, technology transfer, education, international institutions and financial mechanisms.\n\nUnited Nations Agenda 21 Global Dominance 300 page document http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/english/Agenda21.pdf\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMUN 2014 - North American Model United Nations:\nBreaking News updates on the 2014 NAFTA North American Union part of the Globalization process NWO Last days final hour News prophecy update http://www.namun.org/namun.\n\nInformation includes:\nREUTERS News Conference at the State Department in Washington DC - United States Secretary of State John Kerry (Does not talk about USA sovereignty rather Globalization United Nations agenda 21), Canada's Foreign Minister John Baird and Mexico's Foreign Secretary Jose Antonio Meade http://ph.news.yahoo.com/photos/united-states-secretary-state-kerry-watches-canada-39-photo-171404516.html\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins.
