Temple of Love was in fact originally released in 1998 from Dino Music in Holland. Very little is said about the creators of the album, only that their last names are Dekker, van Es and Papen. If I was asked to speculate, I would guess that their full names are Jan Dekker, Ruud van Es and Rob Papen. Ruud and Rob were the guys behind the group Peru, Holland's equivalent to Tangerine Dream.\n\nTemple of Love is mostly an instrumental album with ambient-electronic programming similar to Enigma's earlier work. Song's like Temple of Love and Voices in the Dark feature gregorian chants, while other tracks contain ethnic chants and sampled instruments. There is a prominent beat throughout most of the songs, and many have an almost dream-dance quality about them.\n\n1. Temple of Love 4:39\n2. Water (creativity) 4:45\n3.
