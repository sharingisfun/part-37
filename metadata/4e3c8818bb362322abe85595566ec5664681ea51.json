I searched for this game and only found versions that demanded windows 95 or a CD. I found this one (by Tidosho) here: http://tidelog.kitamuracomputers.net/2012/07/28/two-classic-games-destruction-derby-1-2-for-pc/, but it was hard to find and the download speed was slow.\nI just added the UNIX things, the .sh files and the linux dosbox.conf files.\n\nInstructions\nWindows ALL: \nClick on !Start-Destruction Derby 1.bat or !Start-Destruction Derby 2.bat in the DD12 folder.\nIf it doesn't work see below..\n\nLinux and Mac:\n1. Install dosbox if you don't have it (Debian/Ubuntu run this command: sudo apt-get install dosbox).\n2. go to the downloaded DD12 folder and click on one of the LinuxDD....sh files.\n\nIf it doesn't work, open a terminal in the DD12 folder and run the command:\nchmod +x LinuxDD1.sh LinuxDD2.sh LinuxDD2hires.sh\nthen to play:\nsh LinuxDD1.sh or \nsh LinuxDD2.se or\nsh LinuxDD2hires.sh (more demanding for your computer)\n\n\nIf this failes (WIN and UNIX):\n1. Install dosbox. (google it)\n2. Edit the dosbox conf file, for me in kubuntu it's here: ~/.dosbox/dosbox-0.74.conf.\nMount the DD12 as C: with\nmount c PATH/TO/DD12\nand one of the CD images as D: with\nimgmount d PATH/TO/CD/IMAGE.cue -t iso \nThe CD images is in DD12/CD and the games is in DD12/C/GAMES\n\nFor Windows users, use  instead of /.\n\nHave a nice day!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e3c8818bb362322abe85595566ec5664681ea51","amp;dn":"Destruction+Derby+1+and+2+no+install+dosbox+Win+Linux+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e3c8818bb362322abe85595566ec5664681ea51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,60,136,24,187,54,35,34,171,232,85,149,86,110,197,102,70,129,234,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
