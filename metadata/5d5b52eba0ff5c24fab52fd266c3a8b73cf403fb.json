An installation guide is included in the .rar\nfile.\n\nWith that said, there are newer working cracks of JAWS 11,\nboth 32bit and 64bit, that you can look at by clicking on my\nuser name, Glitch01, on thePirateBay.\n\nWhy am I choosing to keep this torrent?  Well, I just couldn't\nbring myself to just delete this torrent with all its wonderful\ncomments, especially the ungrateful, needy, and demanding\nones.  I suppose I am just a sentimental fool.  *smiles*\n\nAs usual, questions or comments, post them here.\n\n\nSigned,\nGlitch\n\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d5b52eba0ff5c24fab52fd266c3a8b73cf403fb","amp;dn":"Freedom+Scientific+JAWS+11.0.756+32bit++%28by+Glitch%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d5b52eba0ff5c24fab52fd266c3a8b73cf403fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,91,82,235,160,255,92,36,250,181,47,210,102,195,168,183,60,244,3,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
