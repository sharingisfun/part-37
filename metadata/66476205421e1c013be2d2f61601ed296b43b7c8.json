Either play in the relaxing zen mode, or see how quick your wit is with timed mode.\n\nPlace shapes on the 9 by 9 board by dragging the shape from the current shape box. Before you drag, you are able to rotate the shape by tapping it. As you completely fill a 3 by 3 section with any type of shape, that section is cleared for more space. It is game over when you run out of possible moves.\n\nTIMED MODE: Race against the clock and place down a set amount of pieces before the time runs out. At the end of each round, the board is reset, a minute is added to the clock, and you get a new, increased set of pieces. Each round is progressively more difficult.\n\nWhat's New\nV:1.3.1 - Fixed some scoring issues.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ice.fourfishrelease&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ice.fourfishrelease&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66476205421e1c013be2d2f61601ed296b43b7c8","amp;dn":"Four+Fish+v1.3.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66476205421e1c013be2d2f61601ed296b43b7c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,71,98,5,66,30,28,1,59,226,210,246,22,1,237,41,107,67,183,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
