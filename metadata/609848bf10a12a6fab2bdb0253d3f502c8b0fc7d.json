Exposing Russian nuclear threats as a sham, the information - if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s genuine - could shatter East-West relations. Jazz-loving, hard-drinking Blair is hardly the spymastersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ idea of the perfect agent, yet they are forced to send him to Moscow to make contact.\n\nBut the Cold War thaws when Barley meets Katya, the beautiful Russian intermediary who is equally sceptical of state ideology. Mere pawns in a deadly game of international espionage, they nevertheless represent the breakdown of hostilities and a future which poses a huge threat to the entrenched professionals on both sides...\n\nBoth a gripping spy saga and a poignant love story, 'The Russia House' delivers all the excitement and tension expected from the master of espionage fiction.\n\nMain cast\n\nBarley Blair - Tom Baker\nNiki Landau - Danny Webb\nYekaterina Orlova (Katya) - Valentina Yakunina\nWellow - Simon Roberts\nMerridew - David Howarth\nNed - John Rowe\nHarry - Michael Turner\nWalter - John Webb\nClive - Pip Torrens\nBob - Bruce Boa\nWicklow - David Bannerman\nZapadny - Constantine Gregory\nCy - Eric Meyers\nO'Mara - Geoffrey McGivern\nWintle - Paul Brooke\nPaddy - Christopher Fulford\nGoethe - Boris Isarov\nRussell Sheriton - David Healy\nBrady - Ed Bishop\n\nThis BBC Radio 4 adaptation was dramatised by RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Basilico.\n\nBroadcast on BBC Radio 4 between July 20 - August 31, 1994.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1.
