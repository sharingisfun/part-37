There are also good\ncover versions of Captain Beefheart's &quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby,&quot; (it stays in\nthe mind) and Steve McCall's &quot;I'll Be Right Here Waiting.&quot; Then she chose to\nwork with musicians she had long associated with: Aaron Bennett, tenor, John\nFinkbeiner, electric guitar, and Vijay Anderson on the drums.\n\nInto the studio and now out comes What is Known (Clean Feed 192) by Lisa\nMezzacappa and Bait &amp; Switch.\n\nThe pieces hang together well. The band does too, via better living through\n(musical) chemistry and because in part they know each other musically from long\nassociation.\n\nBennett's tenor is raucous and energized, Finkbeiner plays some abstract and\nelectric lines worth your ears' attention, Lisa M. has a forcefully strong tone\nand convinces with what she does. Vijay plays as a group member. What he does is\nright and it's thought through.\n\nNow perhaps one could say that about alot of bands but in this case the material\nLisa has put together moulds the end result to be smart, varied and quite\nstimulating.\n\nThis is a really nice first album and it plays repeatedly in my musical\nlistening cycle right now. Definitely recommended for some worthwhile and very\nmodern jazz improv!\n\n--\n\nby Stef\n\nby Rachel Swan &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/from-bass-to-mezzacappa/Content?oid=1878964&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/from-bass-to-mezzacappa/Content?oid=1878964&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Massimo Ricci\n\nby Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD31/PoD31MoreMoments4.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD31/PoD31MoreMoments4.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\ndi Vincenzo Roggero (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=5734&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=5734&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor Sergio Piccirilli (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2010/10/04/lisa-mezzacappa%E2%80%99s-bait-switch-what-is-known/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2010/10/04/lisa-mezzacappa%E2%80%99s-bait-switch-what-is-known/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43595464c80c4e920f43e92d3592410b90f59cd","amp;dn":"Lisa+Mezzacappa%27s+Bait+%26amp%3B+Switch+-+What+Is+Known+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43595464c80c4e920f43e92d3592410b90f59cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,53,149,70,76,128,196,233,32,244,62,146,211,89,36,16,185,15,89,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
