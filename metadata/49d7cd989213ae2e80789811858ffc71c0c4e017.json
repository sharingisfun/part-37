His body had, though, been preserved in a lead-lined coffin filled with alcohol; theoretically, if the coffin could be located, Jones could be returned to the United States for proper burial. The Admiral and the Ambassador details PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long, unrelenting search for that coffin, first through scraps of archive material and written recollections of funeral attendees, and then beneath the rickety buildings that had been constructed over what he believed to be the graveyard. This book, the only full-length account of the search for and discovery of John Paul JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body, offers a fascinating look into the charismatic, real-life characters who populated the first century of the United States of America.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49d7cd989213ae2e80789811858ffc71c0c4e017","amp;dn":"Scott+Martelle+-+The+Admiral+and+the+Ambassador-+One+Man%27s+Obses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49d7cd989213ae2e80789811858ffc71c0c4e017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,215,205,152,146,19,174,46,128,120,152,17,133,143,252,113,192,196,224,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
