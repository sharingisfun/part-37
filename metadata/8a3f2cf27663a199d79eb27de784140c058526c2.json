Of all the forms of racing, motorcycle street racing is one of the most glamorous, thrilling, and dangerous. Riders reach speeds of nearly two hundred miles per hour and lean so hard into turns that their bodies just hover off the ground. The slightest miscalculation or lapse in concentration will send a rider careening into another racer or hurtling headlong into the pavement. Ubi Soft's Suzuki Alstare Extreme Racing (&quot;SAER&quot; for short) jettisons the subtlety and grossly exaggerates the speed of real motorcycle racing to create a pure arcade-style racing game that takes place in colorful fictional environments instead of closed racing circuits.\n\n- Install Instructions\n1. Mount the image\n2. Run the &quot;CDIntro.exe&quot; or &quot;SETUP.EXE&quot;\n3. Pick your Language\n4. Choose Full Install\n\n\nThat's all\n\n\n- Works at\nWin98, WinXP.\nNot tested on Vista but 95% probably works.
