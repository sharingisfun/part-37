Of the thousands who witnessed this slaughter, it was thought that none remained wild, until the day in 1911 when they called Ishi was captured raiding a slaughterhouse. Dr. Kroeber (Jon Voight) and his wife Henriette (Anne Archer) discover that Ishi (Graham Greene) is the last survivor of the Yahi tribe. In his head he carries the secrets of his people, how they lived and died. These are secrets no man knows - but Dr. Kroeber makes it his mission to uncover them before the last of the Yahi is gone forever. Like Dance With Wolves, THE LAST OF HIS TRIBE takes you into a world of violence, mystery and survival- the world that was still the Old West, before it became new.
