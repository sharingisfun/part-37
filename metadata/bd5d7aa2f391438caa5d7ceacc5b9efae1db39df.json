It was first released as the B-side to &quot;Till the End of the Day,&quot; and was then included on their album The Kink Kontroversy in 1965 (1966 in the US).\n\nThe song has since gained &quot;classic&quot; status and featured on numerous compilations. It was covered by David Bowie on the album Pin Ups, after which Pye Records released the track as a single in November 1973 (Pye 7N 45313 b/w &quot;Lola&quot;). This re-release failed to chart.\n\nIt has also been covered by Van Halen in the album Diver Down. This was Van Halen's second cover of a Kinks' song, the first being You Really Got Me on their eponymous debut album.\n\nThe Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Ray and Dave Davies in 1964. Categorised in the United States as a British Invasion band, the Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era.\n\nTheir music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run.\n\nThe Kinks had five Top 10 singles on the US Billboard chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, the group had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four of their albums have been certified gold by the RIAA. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Outstanding Service to British Music&quot;. In 1990, their first year of eligibility, the original four members of The Kinks were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;the tube&quot; logo at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Have_All_the_Good_Times_Gone&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Have_All_the_Good_Times_Gone&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JanccaAEP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JanccaAEP&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 704x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 15000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 384kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:16\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
