Only 3000 copies of the maxi single were pressed on 12 inch vinyl and CD. Both vinyl and CD counterfeit copies exist, of which the vinyl copies vary in color (the official 12 inch vinyl was only pressed on black vinyl).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e6fc6a35ce60be1ab8bbdbc7634828a231b026e","amp;dn":"NIRVANA+Blew+EP+%28PBTHAL+vinyl%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e6fc6a35ce60be1ab8bbdbc7634828a231b026e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,111,198,163,92,230,11,225,171,139,189,188,118,52,130,138,35,27,2,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
