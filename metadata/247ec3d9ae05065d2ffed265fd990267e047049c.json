So here we go yet again. We got Sabbath Volume 4 this one I re-encoded from SACD flac so credit for source material goes to original uploader. Dont get me wrong SA Compact Disks are just intense. But they are not space savers by any means. Whatever,moving right along we got Metal from the masters get it............  yeah Im havin to list these as audio clips stead of music file name err whaterrther!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:247ec3d9ae05065d2ffed265fd990267e047049c","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath-Volume+4%28Re-encoded+320k%29+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"247ec3d9ae05065d2ffed265fd990267e047049c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,126,195,217,174,5,6,93,47,254,210,101,253,153,2,103,224,71,4,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
