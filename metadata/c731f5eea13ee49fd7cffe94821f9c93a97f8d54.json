As on records with those artists, Wolf's older modes are updated here for a hipper, younger audience ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backed up with a bouncing batch of electrified backings arranged by Sonny Thompson, and conducted by Thompson and Cash McCall, the latter of whom is most likely playing a bit of guitar here. Tracks are a bit longer than usual, and filled with plenty of heavy guitar bits next to the vocals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and titles include &quot;I Smell A Rat&quot;, &quot;Miss James&quot;, &quot;If I Were A Bird&quot;, &quot;She's Lookin Good&quot;, &quot;Turn Me On&quot;, and &quot;Message To The Young&quot;. \n\nTracklist\n\n1 If I Were A Bird\n2 I Smell A Rat\n3 Miss James \n4 Message to the Young \n5 She's Lookin' Good \n6 Just As Long\n7 Romance Without Finance\n8  Turn Me On ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c731f5eea13ee49fd7cffe94821f9c93a97f8d54","amp;dn":"Howlin%5C%27+Wolf++Message+To+The+Young%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c731f5eea13ee49fd7cffe94821f9c93a97f8d54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,49,245,238,161,62,228,159,215,207,254,148,130,31,156,147,169,127,141,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
