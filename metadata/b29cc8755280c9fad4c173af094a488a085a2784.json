Jessie Mae did a little performing at picnic and in church, but it was only in 1979 that docided, as thelast of the family still playing music, to make it her cereer. She toured widely, and won a Handy Awards for album \\'Feelin\\' Good\\' in 1991, but was sidelined by a stroke in 1993. He is death in 2006.\nWhen David Evans met her in 1979, Jessie had only a small repertoire, including the diddley bow piece \\'Take Me Home With You Baby\\'. Evans worked with her on developing her music, creating complementary second guitar parts, and Hemphill expanded her repertoire and added percussion instruments. This is the most recently released CD, includes the earliest recordings. The content is drawn about equally from 1979 and the mid-\\'80s, and while it doesn\\'t provoke any rethinking of Hemphill\\'s status as an artist, the disc carefully programmed. As a result, the foot tambourine on four tracks provides variety rather than monotony, and the exiguousness of some compositions is effectively disguised. Three tracks with diddley bow and some touching, archaic church songs contrast well with band blues like \\'Streamline Train\\', where Hemphill overdubs thunderous drumming, and \\'Jessie\\'s Love Song\\' and \\'Shake Your Booty\\', which feature Joe Hicks and Lois Brown from legendary band The Fieldstones.\nJessie Mae Hemphill was indeed a national treasure, and \\'Get Right Blues\\' makes a wonderful introduction to this amazing musician.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b29cc8755280c9fad4c173af094a488a085a2784","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Jessie+Mae+Hemphill+-+Get+Right+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b29cc8755280c9fad4c173af094a488a085a2784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,156,200,117,82,128,201,250,212,193,115,175,9,74,72,138,8,90,39,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
