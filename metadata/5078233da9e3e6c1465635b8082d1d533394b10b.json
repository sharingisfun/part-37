There are two versions of the main albums, a CD version and a vinyl version, the vinyl versions are marked as such. The vinyls are from a FLAC source, and everything else was 320 CBR MP3. The exception is the XX collection, which was a FLAC rip from a CD.\n\nThe only thing I did was rename folders, remove .cue files, and touch up the faded album cover to the XX album, as I believe it wasn't scanned properly. And of course, I converted everything to V0 MP3 to saved space and preserve quality.\n\nThere's album art included for every album, some are higher resolutions than others, though, I remember a few being very crappy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5078233da9e3e6c1465635b8082d1d533394b10b","amp;dn":"Rage+Against+The+Machine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5078233da9e3e6c1465635b8082d1d533394b10b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,120,35,61,169,227,230,193,70,86,53,184,8,45,29,83,51,148,177,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
