The releases were mostly singles and EPs or part of a various artists underground compilation. The bands are referred to as DIY, or do-it-yourself. Although the songs are generally quite interesting they were too arty and experimental for pop-dominated Rare Hits of The 80s series, so I skipped them while making those series. Then since they are not synth-dominated, quirky and danceable tracks, they could not it into This Is What I call Minimal 80s series either. However this style of music definitely has its own audience and deserves some recognition. More likely than not, some of these tracks are on some people's wish list. So here you are and part 2. Enjoy and seed.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 Home Service - Wake-up!\n02 Michael's Toy - Cry Now It's Over\n03 Last Four (4) Digits - Another Sex Crime\n04 The Mothmen - Does It Matter Irene\n05 The Vincent Units - Carnival Song\n06 Observers Observing Observables - Watch Out For The Other Guy\n07 Someone and The Somebodies - Newvo\n08 The Colors Out Of Time - Dancing With Joy\n09 Three Times A Day - Storm\n10 Treatment Room - Awayday\n11 Those Hellicopters - Southcoast Towns\n12 Cry Shark - One Phone Call\n13 Disturbed Furniture - Information\n14 People In Stores - Metaphor\n15 Science Patrol - Bandit Ducks From Outer Space\n16 Limbo Race - Small Talking\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd65eb90fd63d4e43aa98106e69d547f48204628","amp;dn":"Obscure+80s+Post-Punk%2C+Experimental%2C+Art+Rock+Vol.+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd65eb90fd63d4e43aa98106e69d547f48204628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,101,235,144,253,99,212,228,58,169,129,6,230,157,84,127,72,32,70,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
