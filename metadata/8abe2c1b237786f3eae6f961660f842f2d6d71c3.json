During a threatening run in with the secret police, an unassuming young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) is rescued by a vigilante named V (Hugo Weaving) -- a caped figure both articulate and skilled in combat. V embodies the principles of rebellion from an authoritarian state, donning a mask of vilified would-be terrorist of British history Guy Fawkes and leading a revolution sparked by assassination and destruction. Evey becomes his unlikely ally, newly aware of the cruelty of her own society and her role in it.\n\nÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬\n\nMpaa Rating++++++++++\n\nÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬\n\nRated R for strong violence and some language.\n\nÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬\n\nRetail Release Date++++++++\n\nÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬\n\n17 March 2006\n\nDVD Content++++++++++\n\n \n\nMain Movie+++++++++++++++\n\n+Video- CCE Encoded - 5 passes\n\n+Audio-English, French\n\n+Subs-English, French, Spanish \n \n\nMenu+++++++\n\n+Yes\n\n \n\nExtras/Special Features+++++\n\n+Yes\n\nRemoved++++++++++++++\n\nFBI crap and trailers and all of the other annoying and useless stuff.\n\nÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬\n\nÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬\n\nChapters++++++++++++++\n\nÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬\n\n1.
