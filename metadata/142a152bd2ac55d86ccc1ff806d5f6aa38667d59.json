God loves a party!! Why in the world would Christians only want doom and gloom? God has appointed times for us to rejoice in Him.\r\n\r\nZephaniah 3:14-17 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAre You Certain You will Go At The Rapture?\r\nHow Rapture Ready Are You?
