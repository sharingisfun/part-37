Eddie Long plans to be a country music star, but he's stuck touring the Mississippi casino circuit. But after his nagging wife apparently dies at the hands of a serial killer, Eddie writes the best song of his life. It goes straight to number oneÃ¢â‚¬â€and then all hell breaks loose.\n\nFreelance music writer Jimmy Rogers senses a great opportunity and sets out to write the life story of Nashville's newest sensation. But Jimmy's research unearths some troubling facts about the death of Eddie's wife, facts that could ruin Eddie's burgeoning careerÃ¢â‚¬â€while making Jimmy a star.\n\nThrow in a beautiful and opportunistic country radio deejay, a pair of wily record producers, and a naÃƒÂ¯ve young singer-songwriter and the stage is set. Everybody plans to make a killingÃ¢â‚¬â€one way or another. It's murder on Music Row, where things don't always turn out as planned.\n\nGenre: Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe7e166764f1faa17112b42c29c86b8ece02e42c","amp;dn":"Fender+Benders+by+Bill+Fitzhugh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe7e166764f1faa17112b42c29c86b8ece02e42c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,126,22,103,100,241,250,161,113,18,180,44,41,200,107,142,206,2,228,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
