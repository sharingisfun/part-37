When you practice along with Brittany, Chanelle, Kendra and Suzy under Jules MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expert instruction, you will experience common yoga poses with a fresh perspective. The first three classes are what we call Active Restoration, where you can expect movement and effort. The fourth class is Passive Restoration, where the poses are effortless and restful.\n\nEach Active Restoration class begins with a theme, developed around a particular muscular action or skill, and weaves this theme throughout the sequence of poses. After a dynamic warm up, static poses are introduced and generally build in intensity. Several passive restorative poses close each class.\n\nIntro (4 Minutes)\nProps (7 Minute Demonstration)\nClass One (Foundational Standing Poses) - 65 Minutes\nClass Two (Supported Backbends) - 68 Minutes\nClass Three (Skillful Inversions) - 53 Minutes\nBonus Class (Passive Restoration) - 57 Minutes\n\nVideo; x264; 704*480 (1.738); 1778 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b06b45d12fbcdff330823a97ea521f1ee51fba05","amp;dn":"Active+Restoration+Yoga+with+Jules+Mitchell+2+DVD+Set+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b06b45d12fbcdff330823a97ea521f1ee51fba05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,107,69,209,47,188,223,243,48,130,58,151,234,82,31,30,229,31,186,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
