With producer Stephen Street, the Smiths created a subtly shaded and skilled album, one boasting a fuller production than before. Morrissey and Marr also labored hard over the songs, working to expand the Smiths' sound within their very real boundaries.\n\nFor the most part, they succeed. &quot;I Started Something I Couldn't Finish,&quot; &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma,&quot; &quot;Stop Me if You Think You've Heard This One Before,&quot; and &quot;I Won't Share You&quot; are classics, while &quot;A Rush and a Push and the Land Is Ours,&quot; &quot;Death of a Disco Dancer,&quot; and &quot;Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me&quot; aren't far behind. Strangeways is a graceful way to bow out. While it doesn't match The Queen Is Dead or The Smiths, it offers a summation of the group's considerable strengths.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
