Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nEpisode 283: TACS kicks off with a breakdown of last nightâ€™s GOP debate, Anthony reminisces about Ronald Regan, dissects voter percentages, and we look at a â€œsizzle reelâ€ from the debate. Ant then gets into â€œlate nightâ€ numbers, the officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray and the speculation surrounding the trial, live tweeting the debate and Patton Oswalt, PC firing, â€œBlack Lives Matterâ€ funneling funds to Shaun King, and Shaunâ€™s new and old stance on gun control. We get re-familiar with Crazy Eddie, go through a couple of calls regarding Dice, Jason Ellis, CQâ€™s wallet, Star Wars, TACS limited edition t-shirts, live shows, and we get a crazy whore sister update from a crazy caller. After an appearance by Jesse Ventura, we watch a metal man video, talk conspiracy theories, get a live update from the Freddie Gray mistrial, hear about a trip and fall rape, callers bring up the Patrice benefit, Gilbert Gottfried, fusilli pasta, corkscrew pasta, and it being exactly the same, douchebag. We then take a look at Trump on MSNBC, Deray at the White House, a Brooklyn rabbi gang leader, Rat tells us what his remaining Hanukkah gifts were, and Anthony gets acquainted with â€œgelt,â€ talks about Dan Naturman, a shitbag momâ€™s cancer scam, and an adorable bible scam. We also see drones in Japan, Ant reads the latest on registering your drone, tells us about a drone scare he had, handles some Jameson, brings Opie up for a few, talks about missed interview opportunities, and we hear one of the dumbest questions ever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1508c01a771a5aaca4684ffd2a0dcb45c156756c","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-12-16+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1508c01a771a5aaca4684ffd2a0dcb45c156756c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,8,192,26,119,26,90,172,164,104,79,253,42,13,203,69,193,86,117,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
