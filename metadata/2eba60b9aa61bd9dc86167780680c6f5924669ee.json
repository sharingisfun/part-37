An assortment of his finest solo work, Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon is of great interest to anyone who's ever been a fan of the Beatles, the Plastic Ono Band, Yoko Ono, or simply the genius himself. Ranging from a rendition of Ben E. King's &quot;Stand By Me&quot; to the sounds of the Plastic Ono Band and the Harlem Community Choir on &quot;Happy Xmas&quot; and the classic anti-war anthem &quot;Give Peace A\nChance&quot;, the recordings assembled here stand as a testament to one of rock's most complex and influential musical talents. If you believe that Lennon's greatest period of creativity came to an end with the Beatles, you owe yourself a listen to this album.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Imagine                                              [03:04]\n02.Instant karma!
