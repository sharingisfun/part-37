Founding members Michael Pinder and Ray Thomas performed an initially rhythm and blues-based sound in Birmingham in 1964 along with Graeme Edge and others, and were later joined by John Lodge and Justin Hayward as they inspired and evolved the progressive rock style. Among their innovations was a fusion with classical music, most notably in their seminal 1967 album Days of Future Passed.\nThe band has had numerous hit albums in the UK, U.S., and worldwide. They remain active as of 2009.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9042a1fe3406d1a5b5dc093da5a2289ebd7b63ff","amp;dn":"The+Moody+Blues-1967-1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9042a1fe3406d1a5b5dc093da5a2289ebd7b63ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,66,161,254,52,6,209,165,181,220,9,61,165,162,40,158,189,123,99,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
