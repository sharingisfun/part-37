Every line is shouted, punches miss by a foot, and generally everyone just seems embarrassed to be involved. Sheets has spoken of his affection for Italian horror directors like Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci, but this effort is artless and (even worse) tedious despite its hour running time.&quot;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04686e0a80a531de516229a091757d0f1889902f","amp;dn":"Todd+Sheets%27+Nightmare+Asylum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04686e0a80a531de516229a091757d0f1889902f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,104,110,10,128,165,49,222,81,98,41,160,145,117,125,15,24,137,144,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
