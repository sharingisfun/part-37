But with the band's creation of their own conglomerate (Mid Fi Recordings) in 2002, Spaghetti also found time for a tidy, good-timin' solo career. Sauce appeared in 2004; it featured covers of outlaw country favorites from Kristofferson and Cash as well as a few Spaghetti originals. The Supersuckers were still a band during Eddie's dalliance -- they released a few live records and even toured with Pearl Jam. But by 2005 Spaghetti had found enough time and songs for another solo flight, and Old No. 2 appeared that October. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nLike his previous solo disc Sauce, Old No. 2 is dominated by covers, though Eddie wrote a whopping four new songs for this set (double his output for Sauce), and since this album boasts a significantly lower goofiness quotient than his previous go-round, he offers us some solid and literate country-rock tunes, including the ode to touring &quot;Here We Go&quot; and a rueful look back at a busted romance, &quot;Some People Say.&quot; Old No. 2 is in the tradition of the Supersuckers' periodic visits to the land of twang, with even the AC/DC and Coasters covers boasting a semi-acoustic sawdust-on-the-floor vibe, and his band (anchored by guitarist Jordan Shapiro) kicks up a satisfying amount of dust, even with the amps turned down. While Eddie unwittingly reveals how narrow his vocal range can be on a couple of tunes, he makes with the attitude when he needs to and sounds like he means it when he wants to, and his versions of Bob Dylan's &quot;Tonight I'll Be Staying Here with You&quot; and Willie Nelson's &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot; show the guy is a better interpretive singer than one might expect. Oh, and if you were looking for a straight-up joke, check out the Aerosmith revision on track 11. Old No. 2 is hardly revelatory, but it sounds like Eddie and his pals enjoyed their four days in the studio, and the good vibe is infectious -- lots of guys have tried a whole lot harder without coming up with a record half as enjoyable as this. \n\n01.Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You\n02.All Along\n03.Some People Say\n04.Without Love\n05.Carry Me Home\n06.Hey Sexy\n07.I Don't Wanna Know\n08.Here We Go\n09.I Don't Wanna Grow Up\n10.Everywhere I Go\n11.Sick As A Dog (By Quattro)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcb1f9266bc0fa7334c0b789dabcfcb3d866e0f2","amp;dn":"Eddie+Spaghetti+-+Old+No.+2+%282005%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcb1f9266bc0fa7334c0b789dabcfcb3d866e0f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,177,249,38,107,192,250,115,52,192,183,137,218,188,252,179,216,102,224,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
