Film as its own form of philosophy invokes spectatorship thought as an ethics of desire. Original, exciting and theoretically sophisticated Ã¢â‚¬â€œ focusing on continental philosophy, particularly Guattari, Deleuze, Blanchot, Foucault, Lyotard, Irigaray and Serres Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the book will be of interest to scholars and students of queer, gender and feminist studies, film and aesthetics theory, cultural studies, media and communication, post-structural theory and contemporary philosophical thought.\n\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nQuote:\nSeries editors' preface: for the love of cinema;\nSpectatorship: an inter-kingdom desire;\nA cinema of desire: cinesexuality and asemiosis;\nCinemasochism;\nBaroque cinesexuality;\nBaroque becomings;\nZombies without organs;\nNecrosexuality;\nThe ecosophy of spectatorship;\nBibliography;\nIndex.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nQuote:\nPatricia MacCormack is Senior Lecturer in Communication and Film at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.
