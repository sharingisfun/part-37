This is just a straight MGM/UA LaserDisc played into a stand alone Panasonic DVD recorder.  The transfer looks good, but I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;m sure others can do better.  There is nothing but a text menu that leads into the movie.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Chapters\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; are aprox. every 5 minutes.  There is a brief blank screen at the disc flip.  Compared to the DVD, there is more top and bottom to the picture on the screen.  Perfect transfer?  No, but a nice companion to the crop job of the DVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f4621a9d1f58232293a256e712bfa47f74bd172","amp;dn":"Beatles+Yellow+Submarine+US+LaserDisc+Transfer+4%3A3+Ratio+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f4621a9d1f58232293a256e712bfa47f74bd172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,70,33,169,209,245,130,50,41,58,37,110,113,43,250,71,247,75,209,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
