Fox, the comic's artist and creator, used the strip to comment on barbarian fashion-sense in fantasy games, and later expanded his heroine's story into a three-issue Redfox fanzine.\n\nThe fanzine stories were revised and redrawn to form the early issues of a bimonthly US-format black &amp; white comic. \n\nHarrier Comics published the first ten issues in the UK. Valkyrie Press was then established solely to publish Redfox.\n\nOnce Barry Blair's Samurai is up I will be working on the twenty issues of REDFOX.  Needless to say, I was a big fan of the 80's B&amp;W comic scene and still have a huge collection that is waiting to be scanned.\n\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f759f364a4ef38e8b97e4b915576acf1f3b0c0d","amp;dn":"Redfox+%2301+%281986%29+Harrier+Comics+UK+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f759f364a4ef38e8b97e4b915576acf1f3b0c0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,117,159,54,74,78,243,142,139,151,228,185,21,87,106,207,31,59,12,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
