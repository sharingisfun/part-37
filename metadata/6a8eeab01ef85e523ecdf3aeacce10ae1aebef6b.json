But formerly the territory known as the Indian nations was patrolled by the army with visits from occasional federal peace officers like Rooster Cogburn if John Wayne fans will remember True Grit.\n\nA summit of outlawry has been called by Bill Doolin as played by Robert Armstrong. He brings in the Daltons, the Youngers, Billy the Kid, and the meanest of them all, the Sundance Kid as played by Robert Ryan. This is not the same guy who partnered with Paul Newman. He's a mean cuss and he's the guy that Randolph Scott eventually squares off with for reasons you'll have to see the film for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a8eeab01ef85e523ecdf3aeacce10ae1aebef6b","amp;dn":"Return+of+the+Bad+Men+%281948%29+90+min.Randolph+Scott%2CAnne+Jeffreys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a8eeab01ef85e523ecdf3aeacce10ae1aebef6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,142,234,176,30,248,94,82,62,205,243,174,172,206,16,174,26,235,239,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
