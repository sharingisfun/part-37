What is Bob Ross' story as a man and an artist? How did The Joy of Painting get started? And what was it about Bob himself that made him such a compelling figure?\r\nBlue Ridge PBS will answer these questions and more with this one-hour, high definition documentary. Some of the most surprising elements of the program are the interview segments with celebrities who learned to paint the Bob Ross way including Brad Paisley, Jane Seymour and Terrance Howard. Blue Ridge PBS also secured an interview with Phil Donahue, who played an important role in Bob Ross' career by featuring the artist on his Chicago-based show.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen0.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen1.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen2.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen3.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/21/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen4.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen5.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen6.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen7.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen8.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ca/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen9.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen10.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/67/Bob-Ross-The-Happy-Painter-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: ~1500 Kbps (CRF 21)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Framerate: 29.970 fps\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC (Nero)\r\n * Audio Quality: 0.48 48KHz (~140 Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 1h 3mn\r\n * Part Size: 744 MiB\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container: MKV\r\n * Released: 2011\r\n * Source: HDTV MPEG2 1080i (Thanks to TrollHD)\r\n * Encoder: KarMa\r\n * Merged Subtitles: English\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.wbra.org/videos/local-productions/bob-ross-the-happy-painter\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Sister%20Wendy%20and%20the%20Art%20of%20the%20Gospel\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Andrew%20on%20Churchill\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Art%20of%20Eternity\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Van%20Gogh%3A%20Brush%20with%20Genius\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Travels%20with%20Vasari\r\n\r\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Bob_Ross:_The_Happy_Painter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7115674c31b254f6ae620fb0a7c7b102b512497","amp;dn":"PBS.Bob.Ross.The.Happy.Painter.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7115674c31b254f6ae620fb0a7c7b102b512497","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,17,86,116,195,27,37,79,106,230,32,251,10,124,123,16,43,81,36,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
