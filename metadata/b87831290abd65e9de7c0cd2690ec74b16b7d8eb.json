The group had its origins in the '70s group Mickey Ratt, which had evolved into Ratt by 1983; at that time the band featured vocalist Stephen Pearcy, guitarist Robbin Crosby, guitarist Warren DeMartini, bassist Juan Croucier, and drummer Bobby Blotzer. The band released its self-titled first album independently in 1983, which led to a major label contract with Atlantic Records. Their first album under this deal, 1984's Out of the Cellar, was a major success, reaching the American Top Ten and selling over three million copies. &quot;Round and Round,&quot; the first single drawn from the album, hit number 12, proving the band had pop crossover potential. While their second album, 1985's Invasion of Your Privacy, didn't match the multi-platinum figures of Out of the Cellar, it also reached the Top Ten and sold over a million copies. By that time, the band could sell out concerts across the country and was a staple on MTV and AOR radio. Both Dancin' Undercover (1986) and Reach for the Sky (1988) continued Ratt's platinum streak and their audience, had only slipped slightly by the time of their final album, 1990's Detonator. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\tR2 266812\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Dangerous But Worth The Risk\n02.Back For More\n03.Lovin' You's A Dirty Job\n04.Nobody Rides For Free\n05.Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n06.You're In Love\n07.City To City\n08.Body Talk\n09.Way Cool Jr.\n10.Round And Round\n11.Lay It Down\n12.I Want A Woman\n13.Dance\n14.Wanted Man\n15.Slip Of The Lip\n16.Shame Shame Shame\n17.Lack Of Communication\n18.Over The Edge\n19.Steel River\n20.Way Cool Jr. (MTV Unplugged)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b87831290abd65e9de7c0cd2690ec74b16b7d8eb","amp;dn":"Ratt++-+Tell+The+World+The+Very+Best+Of+Ratt+%282007%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b87831290abd65e9de7c0cd2690ec74b16b7d8eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,120,49,41,10,189,101,233,222,124,12,210,105,14,199,75,22,183,216,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
