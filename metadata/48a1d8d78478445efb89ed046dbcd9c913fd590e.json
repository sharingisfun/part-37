In the first set, Bobby Parker takes the stage to offer eleven soul-stirring blues classics including &quot;Straight Up No Chaser&quot;, &quot;I Ain&amp;#039;t Superstitious&quot;, and &quot;Going Down Slow&quot;. A ten-song set by Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown finds the renowned Texas blues master igniting the stage with such classic songs as &quot;Strange Things Happen&quot; and &quot;Grape Jelly&quot; before the night winds to a rousing close with a ten-song Buddy Guy set highlighted by such tunes as &quot;Done Got Old&quot;, &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;, and &quot;Drowning on Dry Land&quot;. Additional guest appearances by both Santana and Chic icon Nile Rodgers, this is one night of music that blues fans will want to revisit time and again. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc Three - Buddy Guy:\n1.
