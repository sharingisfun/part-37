A higher price was strategically charged to \n\nattract collectors.  All of the ones I've acquired have sound quality\n\n(fidelity) issues.  Notwithstanding the sonics this series (1700) offers more than a \n\nfew treasures.\n\n\nCheck out the miserably out-of-tune piano....Randy Weston makes it sing!\n\nCecil Payne's bari sounds like a cello but the feeling is wonderful, especially\n\nwhen taken as a whole.  I often use this record to put myself to sleep at the end\n\nof another good day.\n\n\nRiverside (RLP-12-232) Fantasy/OJCCD-1747-2   (1990 digital re-issue)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a24ebad6deea9ee63bd2b6be8fd168aed2d5ad","amp;dn":"JAZZ+A+LA+BOHEMIA%2CRandyWeston%2C+trio%2C1956%2COJC+LimitedEditionSerie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a24ebad6deea9ee63bd2b6be8fd168aed2d5ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,162,78,186,214,222,234,158,230,59,210,182,190,143,209,104,174,210,213,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
