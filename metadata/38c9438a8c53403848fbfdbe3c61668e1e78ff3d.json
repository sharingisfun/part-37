The new album was recorded in New York\nat Avatar Studios and produced once again by Angelo Petraglia and Jacquire King.\n\n'Come Around Sundown' is the follow-up to the hugely successful 'Only By The\nNight', which sold over six million copies worldwide and garnered four Grammy\nAwards and two Brits. It's yet another bold and expansive statement by the\nNashville, Tennessee-based quartet who, in the last two years, have become one\nof the biggest bands in the world; also one of the most creatively restless.\n\nAs proven throughout their storied career, Kings of Leon love to work. Whether\nwriting, recording or touring, the band is constantly in motion. Once they\nfinished touring in support of 'Only By The Night' at the end of October of\n2009, they went back in the studio to record in February 2010.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it? Buy it!
