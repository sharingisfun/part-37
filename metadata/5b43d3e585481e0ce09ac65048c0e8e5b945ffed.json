It takes a special breed to ride the fixie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ super lightweight, single-gear bikes with no brakes and riders who are equal part skilled cyclists and suicidal nutcases who risk becoming a smear on the pavement every time they head into traffic. But a guy whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s used to putting his life on the line is about to get more than even he is used to when a routine delivery turns into a life or death chase through the streets of Manhattan. When Wilee picks up his last envelope of the day on a premium rush run, he discovers this package is different. This time, someone is actually trying to kill him. \n\nGenre: Action | Thriller \nIMDB rating: 7.0/10 from 3,833 users \nDirected by: David Koepp \nStarring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Shannon and Dania Ramirez","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b43d3e585481e0ce09ac65048c0e8e5b945ffed","amp;dn":"Premium+Rush+2012+TS+NEW+SOURCE+XviD.MATiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b43d3e585481e0ce09ac65048c0e8e5b945ffed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,67,211,229,133,72,30,12,224,154,198,80,72,192,232,229,185,69,255,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
