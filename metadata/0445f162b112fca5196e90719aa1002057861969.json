Robinson--- Bass, Harmonica, Vocals \nEddie Tuleja--- Guitar \nCarl Wilson--- Vocals \n\nCan\\\\\\'t get this one on CD for some reason - their catalog is a mystery to me.  This is a decent record as well Carl Wilson &amp; Michael Love (the Beach Boys), and Peter Cetera (Chicago) sang guest vocals on the track \\\\\\&quot;Vaea (Va-Ya).\\\\\\&quot;  Legendary pop producer Jeff Barry (Neil Diamond, the Archies, the Shangri-Las, the Monkees) made the record - arguably a weird pick, and you can hear it on the record, but I think they were trying to get commercial on this beast.  just make it a billboard for the band in one last-ditch effort for glory.   \n\nthis is their second &amp; final record as far as I can tell, and they just started to come into their own on this one.  In the days of labels giving bands sometimes 3 or 4 records before dropping them, it makes me wonder if the band just imploded sometime around then, or if nobody liked them.  If anybody has any insights, I\\\\\\'m vaguely curious.\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0445f162b112fca5196e90719aa1002057861969","amp;dn":"King+Harvest...King+Harvest%281976%29%5Bvinyl+rip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0445f162b112fca5196e90719aa1002057861969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,69,241,98,177,18,252,165,25,110,144,113,154,161,0,32,87,134,25,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
