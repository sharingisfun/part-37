But then the ship sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s navigating crash-lands, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accused of killing everyone on board. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard for Jax to defend herself: she has no memory of the crash.\n\nNow imprisoned and the subject of a ruthless interrogation, Jax is on the verge of madness. Then a mysterious man breaks into her cell, offering her freedomÃ¢â‚¬â€for a price. March needs Jax to help his small band of rogue fighters break the Corp monopoly on interstellar travelÃ¢â‚¬â€and establish a new breed of jumper.\n\nJax is only good at one thingÃ¢â‚¬â€grimspaceÃ¢â‚¬â€and it will eventually kill her. So she may as well have some fun in the meantimeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cfcd763617b9247d9f70185b03b9ee7216bc20c","amp;dn":"Ann+Aguirre+-+Grimspace+%26amp%3B+Wanderlust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cfcd763617b9247d9f70185b03b9ee7216bc20c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,252,215,99,97,123,146,71,217,247,1,133,176,59,158,231,33,107,194,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
