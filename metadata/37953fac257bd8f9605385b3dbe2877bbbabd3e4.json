For example: Der Mann lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤uft.\nMany verbs have two parts: one part that comes after the subject and one part that comes at the end of the sentence. For example: Der Mann hat einen Apfel gegessen.\nThe German alphabet contains all the letters of the Roman alphabet and in addition includes the letter ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸.\nThe vowels in some German words have a mark written above them, a pair of dots called an umlaut Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¨. This mark shows you how to properly pronounce the word, and it may distinguish one word from another, which is identical except for the mark. For example: ein Apfel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ zwei ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾pfel.\nGerman has both formal and informal ways to address others, depending on the age of the speaker and his or her relationship to the person or persons being addressed.\n\nThis set will help you:\n\nBuild your vocabulary and language abilities\nRead, write, speak and understand German\nSpeak German without a script\nRetain what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned\nPractice unscripted conversations in German\nNegotiate complex situations with confidence and accuracy\nSample topics include:\n\nThe basics, such as age and family relations\nQuestions, greetings, introductions\nTelling time, calendar terms, the weather\nDirections, locations, dining out\nEmotions, opinions, ideas\nPolitical, media, business terms\nArranging home repairs\nPlanning to move abroad\nDiscussing the arts and tourism\nCareers and conducting interviews\nProblem-solving and commercial transactions\n\nRequirements for Rosetta Stone User Workstations\n\nWindows 2000 or later\nMac OS 10.4 or later\n512 MB RAM\n1 GHz or faster processor speed\n600 MB free hard-drive space (per level)\n16-bit sound card\n800 x 600 display resolution (1024 x 768 recommended)\nInternet or phone connection required for product activation\nSpeech recognition feature requires a USB headset microphone (included with purchase)\n16X CD-ROM Drive (for installation)\nNote for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ users:\n\nCurrent Rosetta Stone products have been engineered to install and run on the Windows Vista operating system.
