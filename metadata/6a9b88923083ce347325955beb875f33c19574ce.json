There are 48 tunes from many artists mixed, scratched and cut. The album came about as a result of a 1998 guest DJ appearance by Howlett on Mary Anne Hobbs's Breezeblock show on the UK radio station Radio 1, producing a similar set. In a bid to stop popular bootleg copies of the show, an official album, essentially an extended version of the Breezeblock mix, was released. The two mixes are not quite the same as permission to use certain tunes was not forthcoming for all samples. Most notable is the removal of The Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; which was also left off The Chemical Brothers's Brothers Gonna Work It Out DJ Mix but was left on the earlier promo release Radio 1 Anti-Nazi Mix..\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\nSection 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:18\nRun-D.M.C., &quot;Here We Go (Live At The Funhouse)&quot; (1985) - is labeled as &quot;Intro Beats&quot; in the CD booklet.\nRasmus, &quot;Punk Shock&quot; (1998) - is mislabeled as &quot;Tonto's Release&quot; in the CD booklet.\nHardnoise, &quot;Untitled&quot; (1991)\nThe Chemical Brothers, &quot;Chemical Beats&quot; (1995)\nUltramagnetic MCs, &quot;Kool Keith Housing Things&quot; (1988)\nLightnin' Rod featuring Jalal, &quot;Sport&quot; (1988)\nUltramagnetic MCs, &quot;Give the Drummer Some&quot; (1988)\nTime Zone, &quot;Wildstyle&quot; (1983)\n\nSection 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:44\nBomb the Bass, &quot;Bug Powder Dust&quot; (1994)\nTrouble Funk, &quot;Pump Me Up&quot; (1984) - is mislabeled as being by Grandmaster Flash &amp; The Furious Five.\nThe Charlatans, &quot;How High&quot; (1997)\nProdigy, &quot;Poison&quot; (1995)\nJane's Addiction, &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; (1990)\nTim Dog featuring KRS-One, &quot;I Get Wrecked&quot; (1993)\n\nSection 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:03\nBabe Ruth, &quot;The Mexican&quot; (1972)\nThe B-Boys, &quot;Rock the House&quot; (1983)\nThe Chemical Brothers, &quot;(The Best Part of) Breaking Up&quot; (1996)\nWord of Mouth, &quot;King Kut&quot; (1985)\n\nSection 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:52\nDJ Mink, &quot;Hey!
