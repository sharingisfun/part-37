The only non-bird sounds are surf, rain, wind and a babbling stream. The recordings are remarkably clear. Like many people who find living a city where the only sounds seem to be the sound of cars and the hustle and bustle of city life itÃƒÂ¢??s a real blessing to relax listening to nature after a stressful day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and please show you care by seeding to at least 1.5 ratios\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16171be6faedf25ca145ca2ec829720d817c90cd","amp;dn":"Echoes+of+Nature+-+Morning+Songbirds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16171be6faedf25ca145ca2ec829720d817c90cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,23,27,230,250,237,242,92,161,69,202,46,200,41,114,13,129,124,144,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
