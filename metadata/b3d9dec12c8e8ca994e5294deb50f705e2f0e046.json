There is a real risk of life-threatening injuries or paralysis and Iain has not a minute to spare.\nIn Bristol, Dean Ã¢â‚¬ËœWingnutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wiltshire is with a young homeless man in the city centre who is suffering the effects of alcohol withdrawal. At first, it seems that all he needs is a sympathetic ear, but before long, Dean discovers that something else entirely is a foot.\nRich Coad Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who at 24 years old is the baby of the Bristol biker paramedics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is with Beryl, who may have had a seizure.

The situation is complicated by the fact that Beryl also has ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease. Daughter Sarah, who gave up work to look after her mum, is by her side throughout and Rich is full of admiration for her.\nVeteran biker cop Steve Ã¢â‚¬ËœClemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Clements loves his job Ã¢â‚¬â€œ particularly the fact that things are very rarely what they seem to be.

This simple piece of surveillance sparks an investigation with very interesting results and Clem is soon reaching for his handcuffs.\nFinally, Mick Wills is on the tail of a speeding biker.
