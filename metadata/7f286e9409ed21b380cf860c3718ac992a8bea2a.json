It will not burn onto a regular 4.5gb disk.\n\n Many thanks to bfg, sonicomen and GPater11093 for providing the content for this disk :thumbsup:\n\n This was my overly ambitious attempt to make a spoiler free collection of all the middleweight Title fights from 1980 to the present day.... the collection actually starts in 1978 :lol:\n\nEDIT: I got as far as 1994. So this collection has 16 years of World title fights in the middleweight division - That's sixty-six title fights (and several bonus fights and documentaries) all in a Spoiler-Free chronological order (more or less). There are 20 disks in total.\n\nThe idea behind this set is that if you download each disk in order: You will be able to watch every single Middleweight Title fight in the correct order and without spoilers ( This is for the benefit of any members who have not seen the fights and do not know the results ).\n\nThis collection includes all WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO Middleweight title fights from 1980 to 1993. Some British and European title fights feature along with a few eliminator bouts.....if my memory serves me correctly! Enjoy.\n\n This is Disk 1 of 20 ;-) \n\nNot all the disks in this collection are NTSC and/or Dual-Layer (DVD9).\n\n Watch history in the making as titles change hands and real legends of the ring are born. All bouts on this disk are for the WBA &amp; WBC Middleweight titles:\n\n Disk One is a taster of what I have in mind and will lead us nicely into the 1980's:\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/534/5am8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/534/5am8.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/845/u1bk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/845/u1bk.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/842/qbvh.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/842/qbvh.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/19/7z1a.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/19/7z1a.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/594/q2yr.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/594/q2yr.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f286e9409ed21b380cf860c3718ac992a8bea2a","amp;dn":"Middleweight+World+Title+Fights%281978-1979%29%28Disk+1%29-desspratt-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f286e9409ed21b380cf860c3718ac992a8bea2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,40,110,148,9,237,33,179,128,207,134,12,55,24,172,153,42,139,234,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
