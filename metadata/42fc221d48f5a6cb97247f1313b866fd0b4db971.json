This character was used in the Freedom Fighters comic from the 70's.\n\nThis is the complete run of the Quality comics quarterly run, and I even threw in 2 issues that I found that were published by IW comics from the same period.\n\nPlease seed and enjoy this!  I will only keep it going till my share ratio hits 5 due to the limited bandwidth I have, after that it's up to you all to keep it going!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42fc221d48f5a6cb97247f1313b866fd0b4db971","amp;dn":"Doll+Man+Quality+Comics+Complete+1941-1952","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42fc221d48f5a6cb97247f1313b866fd0b4db971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,252,34,29,72,245,166,203,151,36,127,19,19,184,102,253,11,77,185,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
