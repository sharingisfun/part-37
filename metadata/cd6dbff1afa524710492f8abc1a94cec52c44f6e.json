His ability to improvise at the drop of a hat was exploited to the full here, resulting in seven long, extraordinary songs. Songs of travel, women, gambling, religion and music develop over White's mesmerically rhythmic guitar and, on two tracks, piano. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd6dbff1afa524710492f8abc1a94cec52c44f6e","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Bukka+White+-+Sky+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd6dbff1afa524710492f8abc1a94cec52c44f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,109,191,241,175,165,36,113,4,146,248,171,193,169,76,236,82,196,79,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
