This book explores children's thoughts and feelings on the subject of death and provides parents and other caring adults with guidance on how to respond to difficult questions. The author explores some of the most common questions children ask about death and provides sensitive yet candid answers, phrased in a way that children will be able to understand and relate to. Each chapter is devoted to a particular issue, such as religious beliefs, coming to terms with terminal illness, and the fear of forgetting someone when they are gone. \n\n \n\nThe book recognizes the emotions and reactions of children and family members and includes separate conclusions for parents and children. This guide offers useful advice for parents and carers and will also be of interest to counsellors and other professionals working with children............\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35b4be159f4a3c9069f56b7ae63d90b2573ab77b","amp;dn":"Great+Answers+to+Difficult+Questions+About+Death%3A+What+Children+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35b4be159f4a3c9069f56b7ae63d90b2573ab77b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,180,190,21,159,74,60,144,105,245,107,122,230,61,144,178,87,58,183,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
