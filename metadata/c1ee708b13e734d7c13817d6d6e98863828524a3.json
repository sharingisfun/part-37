His hands-on horsemanship clinics have steadily gained popularity throughout the United States, regularly drawing near-capacity crowds. Both his popularity and the effectiveness of Downunder Horsemanship techniques are reflected in the fact that he's sold over 300,000 copies of his training tapes and DVD's worldwide.\n\nIn 2001, Clinton became the only equine clinician to produce a weekly one-hour&quot; made-for-TV&quot; training show seen nationally on both DirecTV and the Dish Network by approximately 28 million households. Viewers have been impressed with his knowledge of horses and his humane training methods as well as his unique ability to pass these methods on to others. Clinton perfectly balances information with entertainment by using humor and personal experiences to create a one-of-a-kind program enjoyed by equestrians of all ages and levels of experience. A recent survey done by RFD-TV showed that Downunder Horsemanship is the highest rated, most watched show of all equine programming, and the second most popular rated show overall on the entire network.\n\nIn 2003 and again in 2005, Anderson faced the country's best horse trainers and clinicians in the prestigious Road To The Horse Competition, becoming the first person to win the event twice in a row.\n\nToday Clinton continues an exhausting schedule of producing his weekly TV show, creating an extensive library of training tapes, and regularly touring the country making personal appearances and teaching horsemanship clinics. His easy-to-understand Downunder Horsemanship methods have helped literally tens of thousands of horse owners over the years improve the relationship shared with their horse. One has only to watch Clinton Anderson in action to understand that he possesses the uncommon ability to bridge the communication gap between people and their horses in a uniquely informative and entertaining manner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1ee708b13e734d7c13817d6d6e98863828524a3","amp;dn":"Equestrian+Training%3A+C.+Anderson%5C%27s+Horsemanship+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1ee708b13e734d7c13817d6d6e98863828524a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,238,112,139,19,231,52,215,193,56,23,214,214,233,136,99,130,133,36,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
