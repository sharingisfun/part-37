The first creator owned series by one of the most successful teams in all of modern comics. Scarlet is the story of a woman pushed to the edge by all the wrong with the world...A woman who decides to stand up and fight back...A woman who will not back down...A woman who discovers within herself the power to start a modern American revolution!! In the vein of Alias, Powers, and Jinx, Scarlet debuts a fascinating new comics character that, with every issue, reveals new things about herself against a completely original backdrop of intrigue and drama. Get in on the ground floor of the first creator owned series by Maleev...ever. (and yes, the trademark obnoxious Bendis letter column will be here too).\n\nTHE AWARD WINNING, BEST SELLING, POWERHOUSE CREATIVE TEAM BEHIND DAREDEVIL, HALO, AND THE AVENGERS UNLEASH THEIR BOLDEST PROJECT YET! SCARLET! \n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded] - The Hollows - (#001-010) | (Amanda Hocking):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8948592&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8948592&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - State of Decay OST (2013) - Jesper Kyd:\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any question please feel free to ask! **\t ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5df63dae1f859be67b136c2c376912277ab205a","amp;dn":"Scarlet+%28%23001-007%29+%7C+%28Brian+Michael+Bendis%29+%5BOngoing%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5df63dae1f859be67b136c2c376912277ab205a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,223,99,218,225,248,89,190,103,177,54,194,195,118,145,34,119,171,32,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
