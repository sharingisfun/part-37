Trine shatters. With a literally heartless ancient sorcerer on the loose, and only a broken artifact to guide them, the heroes must try and repair the damage they've caused... or the damage that might yet be done.\nTrine 3: The Artifacts of Power is a fairytale journey which takes you on a quest with three heroes: Amadeus the Wizard, Pontius the Knight, and Zoya the Thief.\nThis tale of a grand adventure as well as the additional challenge levels provide true tests to the three heroes' skills in combat and of solving puzzles in the most creative ways.\nPlayable either in singleplayer, and with friends online or in local co-op.\nOnline and Local Co-op - Up to three players can play online and local co-up.
