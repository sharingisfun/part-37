Ella Fitzgerald is in the spotlight throughout, mostly singing swing-era songs along with a couple of newer pieces, such as &quot;Hallelujah I Love Him So&quot; and &quot;No Moon at All.&quot; &quot;I Can't Face the Music&quot; is the longest performance at 5:01, and all but three of the other selections are under three minutes, so there is no real stretching out. However, Ella's voice was in its prime, and the charts are excellent. \n\nElla with:\nRay Copeland, Ernie Royal, Taft Jordan &amp; Joe Wilder - Trumpets\nMelba Liston, Kai Winding &amp; Britt Woodman - Trombones\nCarl Davis, Jerry Dodgion, Wilmer Shakesnider, Les Taylor &amp; Phil Woods - Reeds\nBill Doggett - Organ\nHank Jones - Piano\nMundell Lowe - Guitar\nLucille Dixon - Bass\nGus Johnson - Drums\nGeorge Duvivier replaces Lucille Dixon on Track 1\n\n01.
