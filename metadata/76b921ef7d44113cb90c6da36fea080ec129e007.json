Roy and Dave sing us into news about Daveâ€™s upcoming Star Wars episode, we hear from Shock Jock Robot, Dave talks about pissing in cups and his daughterâ€™s dream future career (unrelated), he discusses Photoshopâ€™s, the crew does a talent show, and we hear some Truck Drivinâ€™ Man. Roy has some Roy rage, Flutesy plays her mystery song, Dave plays a Star Wars game (shout out to Poster Posse), Dave talks about Vin Scully, and rants about his time at SiriusXM through music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76b921ef7d44113cb90c6da36fea080ec129e007","amp;dn":"East+Side+Dave+Show+2016-09-27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76b921ef7d44113cb90c6da36fea080ec129e007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,185,33,239,125,68,17,60,185,12,109,163,111,234,8,14,193,41,224,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
