Will the gaggle of perverts at the seat of power create an external distraction to salvage both Houses in late October or early November?\n\nAlex also covers the nuclear test and proliferation of North Korea and how it exposes the Neo-Cons as hypocrites in attempting to build a case and planning to attack Iran while deliberately downplaying the warmongering Kim Jong-il. Alex also talks about Google\\&amp;#039;s censorship of Terror Storm.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a168e4795f971477bef25872b0b46b69245fa04","amp;dn":"The+Alex+Jones+Report+October+20th+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a168e4795f971477bef25872b0b46b69245fa04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,22,142,71,149,249,113,71,123,239,37,135,43,11,70,182,146,69,250,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
