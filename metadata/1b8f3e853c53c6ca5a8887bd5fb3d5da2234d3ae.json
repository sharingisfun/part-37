Only the catchy \\\\\\&quot;4 Seasons\\\\\\&quot; and the guitar-vocal-only \\\\\\&quot;I\\\\\\'m Nothing\\\\\\&quot; are in the jittery busking style of their previous album. There are a modest number of harder-rocking selections here, such as \\\\\\&quot;Key of 2,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Don\\\\\\'t Start Me on the Liquor,\\\\\\&quot; and the title track. The rest of the songs are highly eccentric, showing wide stylistic variation. \\\\\\&quot;Mirror Mirror\\\\\\&quot; is an ethnic-flavored ditty that would fit right alongside the numbers in the Broadway musical Fiddler on the Roof; oddly, the song ends with an avant-garde jazz improvisation section. \\\\\\&quot;Jesus of Rio\\\\\\&quot; alternates between slow waltz and fast polka sections. \\\\\\&quot;Breakin\\\\\\' Up,\\\\\\&quot; with lyrics that reference Neil Sedaka\\\\\\'s \\\\\\&quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do,\\\\\\&quot; is a dour, menacing slow-tempo number that features growling, low-register singing. Also threatening in manner is \\\\\\&quot;This Island Life,\\\\\\&quot; a moderate-speed song with a girl group-derived thumping beat, a more upfront chorus, and a psychedelic closing section. Most unusual of all is \\\\\\&quot;Machine\\\\\\&quot;; derived from synthesizer techno-dance-beat music, this selection also slows the tempo considerably from other examples in that genre, mechanizes the musical delivery, and features electronically altered vocals. Lyrics are intelligent and effective; two selections, \\\\\\&quot;Agamemnon\\\\\\&quot; and the title cut, have verses derived from Walter Mehring\\\\\\'s Einfach Klassisch. Sound quality and production are good. This at times bewildering album is worth a listen, especially for those with eclectic taste.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8f3e853c53c6ca5a8887bd5fb3d5da2234d3ae","amp;dn":"Violent+Femmes+-+New+Times+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8f3e853c53c6ca5a8887bd5fb3d5da2234d3ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,143,62,133,60,83,198,202,90,136,135,189,95,179,213,218,34,52,211,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
