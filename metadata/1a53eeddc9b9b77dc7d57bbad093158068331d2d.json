This famous highway, originally stretching almost from coast to coast (Chicago to LA), has not only been immortalised in song, but is also a powerful iconic symbol of American freedom and the 'road trip' concept. To travel its length represents an adventure through the diverse history and culture of the USA's heartland - from the bustling streets of the 'Windy City', via the vast, open spaces and dramatic landscapes of the old West. Along the way Henry takes in the stunning Grand Canyon, the glitz of Las Vegas, laid-back 'La-La Land' home of Hollywood and Beverly Hills stamping ground of the super rich. Join us for an inspirational journey in search of the American Dream.\n\n\n1)  Chicago to Illinois \nMotorcycle fanatic Henry Cole sets off across America on Route 66 - the star iconic highway, which takes in 7 states and was once the main artery from Chicago to Los Angeles. The first stage involves collecting his Harley in Chicago before hitting the road and making an overnight stop at Bloomington - the first one horse town of many!\n\n2)  Carlinville and Mount Olive, Missouri \nToday, Henry heads further on into Illinois and Missouri on his 3000-mile journey across the country. He visits the quaint town of Carlinville and the famous bar, Angus Bailey's, and stops at the country's first ever petrol station in Mount Olive. Then it's off to find the Chain of Rocks Bridge, which crosses the Mississippi and the Arch in St Louis, just two of the wonders on Route 66. Unfortunately, though, the heat and the hassle of navigating are now getting to Henry - and his Harley!\n\n3)  Cuba, Lebanon and Claremont, Oklahoma \nHenry Cole reveals the best hotel en route in Missouri, Dickies Inn, a quaint and old colonial retreat. Henry presses on to fascinating towns with just as fascinating names like Rolla, Cuba and Lebanon arriving in Claremont Oklahoma where he takes a tour of Will Rogers's birthplace - and reveals why Route 66 was named after this Hollywood legend. To some its still called The Will Rogers Highway.\n\n4)  Texola, Shamrock and Amarillo \nHenry Cole is almost half way on this gruelling road trip. Crossing the state line into Texas he arrives in the ghost town of Texola before heading onto Shamrock, the first inhabited town in the state. It was once one of the largest oil rich towns in Texas before the Interstate was born but now you're lucky if you see another person or car all morning! From Shamrock Henry heads on to Amarillo where his sound recordist attempts a centuries old tradition in one of the most famous restaurants - eating a 72 oz steak in one hour! As soundman Sean recovers from his gluttony the rain starts to set in and the problems seem impossible on The Mother Road!\n\n5)  Rain, Rain Go Away \nIt's not fun in torrential rain - the road turns to mud and on a Harley it becomes too dangerous to ride on. Henry decides to revert to the interstate and press on through the panhandle of Texas and into New Mexico trying to beat the thunderstorms. The rain and frustration make for a few very bad tempered days!! Finally Henry arrives in Gallup on the borders of Texas and Arizona drenched but elated because it seems he has beaten the rain!\n\n6)  More Rain, Fast Food and Texas \nHenry heads deep into Arizona sure that he has beaten the rain he encountered in Texas - but just as he thinks it's passed torrential storms start again. He arrives in Halbrook where he lives in a concrete wigwam and spends the days playing ten pin bowling, eating fast food and doing the laundry. And we all learn what it's really like to make a travel show on the road - will the rain ever go?\n\n7)  From the Mojave Desert to California \nThe final stage of this marathon journey and Henry Cole heads off through the desert into Arizona and California on the conclusion of his three thousand mile motorcycle ride across America. The sun beats down after days of rain as Henry travels through the fascinating desert towns of Kingman and Oatman. This is an area of America where time has passed by and the Wild West remains. From the peace and tranquillity of the Mojave Desert to the frenetic freeways of California: Henry visits the first ever McDonalds, the gangland downtown of San Bernardino and rolls into Los Angeles and the end of Route 66 in Santa Monica.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img525.imageshack.us/img525/1152/ridingroute66screen0.jpg&quot;
