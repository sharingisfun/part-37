The band ceased to be in 1999 after frontman Mark Sandman died of a heart attack.\n\nMorphine combined blues and jazz elements with more traditional rock arrangements, giving the band a very unusual sound. Sandman's distinctive singing was described as a &quot;deep, laid-back croon,&quot; and his songwriting featured a prominent beat influence. When asked by reporters to describe their music, the band created the label &quot;low rock&quot;. One critical appraisal suggests that &quot;Morphine immediately established a minimalist, low-end sound that could have easily become a gimmick: a 'power trio' not built around the sound of an electric guitar. Instead, with sly intelligence, Morphine expanded its offbeat vocabulary on each album.&quot;\n\nGood is the first album recorded by the band\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Good&quot; \n   2. &quot;The Saddest Song&quot; \n   3. &quot;Claire&quot; \n   4. &quot;Have a Lucky Day&quot; \n   5. &quot;You Speak My Language&quot; \n   6. &quot;You Look Like Rain&quot; \n   7. &quot;Do Not Go Quietly Unto Your Grave&quot; \n   8. &quot;Lisa&quot; \n   9. &quot;The Only One&quot; \n  10. &quot;Test Tube Baby/Shoot Em Down&quot; \n  11. &quot;The Other Side&quot; \n  12. &quot;I Know You (Part One)&quot; \n  13. &quot;I Know You (Part Two)&quot; \n\nBand members\n\n    * Mark Sandman - 2-string slide bass, vocals, organ,guitar,tritar\n    * Dana Colley - baritone sax, tenor sax, double sax, triangle\n    * Jerome Dupree - percussions\n\nThis is a FLAC rip from a DAT (Digital Audio Tape), so the quality is the same of a CD, and the covers are included but (of course) the CD image itself.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45e66f8fd1ff03c91f012b38fe652276d489bfcd","amp;dn":"Morphine+-+Good+-+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45e66f8fd1ff03c91f012b38fe652276d489bfcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,230,111,143,209,255,3,201,31,1,43,56,254,101,34,118,212,137,191,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
