Immediately she became a hit, with her blend of country and her sweet and memorable voice. Her first hit single was &quot;Don't Tell Me What To Do&quot;, followed by the hit which defined her career, the ballad &quot;Maybe It Was Memphis&quot;. This was followed by hits such as the fun and spirited &quot;Shake the Sugar Tree&quot;, and the beautiful ballad &quot;Let That Pony Run&quot;. Probably one of her cathiest songs is the uptempo song &quot;Cleopatra, Queen of Denial&quot;. &quot;Spilled Perfume&quot; is one of my favorites, about a one night stand. &quot;When You Walk In The Room&quot; is classic, and &quot;In Between Dances&quot; is a really sweet ballad. &quot;Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life)&quot; is another fun uptempo song, and the closing &quot;The River and The Highway&quot; is a beautiful ballad about two scorned lovers, with one of the most beautiful videos I've seen in country music. The GREATEST HITS also includes two great new songs. &quot;All The Good Ones Are Gone&quot;, the first single from the set, is a ballad relenting that all the good men are taken, and that time may be running out. &quot;Land of the Living&quot; is my favorite though, a fun upbeat song about telling someone to join the land of the living, because things have changed. Overall you can't lose with this collection, its essential listening, and reminds you what a shame it is she is no longer played anymore on country radio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d420ef1fe3602f13cbb41b40ba11d9d8258ced3","amp;dn":"Pam+Tillis+-+Greatest+Hits+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d420ef1fe3602f13cbb41b40ba11d9d8258ced3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,66,14,241,254,54,2,241,60,187,65,180,11,161,29,157,130,88,206,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
