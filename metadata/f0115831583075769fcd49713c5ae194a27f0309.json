It is without question one of the most famous battles in history. Now, for the first time since Gordon W. PrangeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestselling Miracle at Midway, Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully offer a new interpretation of this great naval engagement. Unlike previous accounts, Shattered Sword makes extensive use of Japanese primary sources. It also corrects the many errors of Mitsuo FuchidaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Midway: The Battle That Doomed Japan, an uncritical reliance upon which has tainted every previous Western account. It thus forces a major, potentially controversial reevaluation of the great battle. The authors examine the battle in detail and effortlessly place it within the context of the Imperial NavyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doctrine and technology. With a foreword by leading WWII naval historian John Lundstrom, Shattered Sword will become an indispensable part of any military buffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s library. Winner of the 2005 John Lyman Book Award for the &quot;Best Book in U.S. Naval History&quot; and cited by Proceedings as one of its &quot;Notable Naval Books&quot; for 2005.\n\n\nNote: All chapter links work using the applications Aldiko for Android and Calibre for PC for the epub file, and Kindle on both devices for the mobi file.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0115831583075769fcd49713c5ae194a27f0309","amp;dn":"Shattered+Sword+ebook+by+Parshall+and+Tully+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0115831583075769fcd49713c5ae194a27f0309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,17,88,49,88,48,117,118,159,205,73,113,60,90,225,148,162,127,3,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
