The film is set in New York City, soon after the Vietnam War. The film stars Robert De Niro and features Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, Leonard Harris, Peter Boyle, Cybill Shepherd, and a young Jodie Foster. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film gained further notoriety when John Hinckley, Jr. claimed that it was his obsession with Foster's role that made him attempt to assassinate Ronald Reagan in 1981.\n\nLegendary for Robert De Niro's intense method performance; Paul Schrader's hard hitting exisentialist script, a blend of Sartre's La Nausee and the diaries of would be political assassin Arthur Bremer; and movie brat Martin Scorsese's extraordinarily fluid, cine literate direction, Taxi Driver is one of the key films of the 1970s as film and as example of the zeitgeist, and thereby an absolute must-see for anyone who loves cinema.\n\nOperating on multiple levels, the film presents a deeply ironic examination of the myth of the cowboy via the figure of Travis Bickle, a would be John Wayne hero displaced in time from the 1870s to the 1970s and in place from the frontier to the mean streets of New York.\n\nTaking a job as a taxi driver, the Vietnam veteran's fragile mind soon begins to crack in the face of the corruption that surrounds him most everywhere he looks. Things come to a head over two women, the unattainable campaign worker Betsy , the classic virgin, and too available 13 year old runaway prostitute Iris, the classic whore.\n\nAfter a disastrous date when Travis takes Betsy to a porno theatre, some fascinating documentary material of the pre clean up 42nd Street, Travis resolves to take a stand, to make the world sit up and take notice. His target, Presidential candidate Palantine, the father figure who, in his warped mind, represents the reason Betsy has rejected him...\n\nForget The Assassination of Richard Nixon, good as it is; Taxi Driver is the original and best.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Taxi Driver (1976)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Taxi Driver (1976)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 2.31 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 909 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf51.12.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate                         : 2 577 Kbps\nWidth                            : 852 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.263\nStream size                      : 2.05 GiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : Lavc51.40.4\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 260 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 26 ms (0.63 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5126\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/18/2010 5:56:47 AM\nmbam-log-2010-11-18 (05-56-47).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 6\nTime elapsed: 20 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
