While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia - who is slowly regaining her powers - it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0161ef7f6524ee2a5320ba73f8672408bb39afe5","amp;dn":"Bleach+-+Vol.+35","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0161ef7f6524ee2a5320ba73f8672408bb39afe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,97,239,127,101,36,238,42,83,32,186,115,248,103,36,8,187,57,175,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
