Lee (Rhys Darby) is a young, skilled OBGYN who lacks confidence when it comes to talking to women outside his successful medical practice. A minor injury temporarily lands him in a wheelchair and it is at that precise time that he meets his dream girl Alex (Sasha Alexander). Convinced sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only paid attention to him because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in that chair, he stays in it to win her affections well after his injury has healed. Coming &amp; Going is about love and the extreme things people do for it.\n\nGenre: Comedy\nIMDB Rating: 5.2/10 from 369 users\nDirected by: Edoardo Ponti\nStarring: Rhys Darby, Sasha Alexander and Fionnula Flanagan\n\nRelease Name: Coming.And.Going.2011.BDRip.x264-PFa\nSize: 691 MB\nVideo: MKV | 720 x 404 | 1040 Kbps\nAudio: English | AAC\nRuntime: 1h 32mn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6be8732be388a2ecf164e4d97b9abf43644cb2f6","amp;dn":"Coming+And+Going+2011+BDRip+x264-PFa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6be8732be388a2ecf164e4d97b9abf43644cb2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,232,115,43,227,136,162,236,241,100,228,217,123,154,191,67,100,76,178,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
