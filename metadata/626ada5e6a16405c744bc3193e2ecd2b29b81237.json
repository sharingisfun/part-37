The trio managed to record a 1969 album for the small J&amp;S label. Produced by Zell Sanders, &quot;Just Like You&quot; wasn't half bad. Responsible for all nine tracks, Schuller and Belliveau (credited with co-writing four of the selections) were decent writers with an ear for churning blues-rock (&quot;Take My Soul&quot;). Sure, the vocals were frequently strained and there wasn't a shred of originality on Cream and Mountain influenced tracks such as &quot;Slumberland Blues&quot;,or &quot;Second Time for Me&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;I Don't Know Who To Blame&quot; offered up some first rate screaming guitar, the organ-propelled &quot;What's Right For Me&quot; would've made Deep Purple proud and the atypical acoustic ballad &quot;Just Like You&quot; boasted a sweet melody. Besides, the trio offered up more enthusiasm than many of their name brand competitors and remeber that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. All told, one of the better undiscovered era offerings.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:626ada5e6a16405c744bc3193e2ecd2b29b81237","amp;dn":"Pugsley+Munion+-+Just+Like+You++%281970%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"626ada5e6a16405c744bc3193e2ecd2b29b81237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,106,218,94,106,22,64,92,116,75,195,25,62,46,205,43,41,184,18,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
