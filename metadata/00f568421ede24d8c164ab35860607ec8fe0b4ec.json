Formed in 1957, the SI was active in Europe through the 1960s and aspired to major social and political transformations.\n\nThe most prominent French member of the group, Guy Debord, has tended to polarise opinion. Guy Debord's best known works are his theoretical books, Society of the Spectacle and Comments on the Society of the Spectacle. In addition to these he wrote a number of autobiographical books. \n\nIn broad terms, Debord's theories attempted to account for the spiritually debilitating modernisation of both the private and public spheres of everyday life by economic forces during the post-WW2 modernisation of Europe. He rejected as the twin faces of the same problem both capitalism of the West and the statism of the Eastern bloc. Alienation, Debord postulated, could be accounted for by the invasive forces of the 'spectacle' - &quot;a social relation between people that is mediated by images&quot;. Debord's analysis developed the notions of &quot;reification&quot; and &quot;fetishism of the commodity&quot; pioneered by Karl Marx and Georg LukÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡cs. This analysis probed the historical, economic and psychological roots of 'the media'. Central to this school of thought was the claim that alienation is more than an emotive description or an aspect of individual psychology: rather, it is a consequence of the mercantile form of social organization which has reached its climax in capitalism.\n\nGuy Debord made six films between 1952 and 1978. Following the still-unsolved assassination of the filmsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ producer in 1984, all of them were withdrawn from circulation for nearly twenty years...\n\n*******************************\n\nOriginal Title: Hurlements en faveur de Sade\nReleased: 1952\nEng.
