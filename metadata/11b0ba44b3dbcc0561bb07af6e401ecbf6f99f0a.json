Heartland Reprise (1:11)\n\nThe third Client album &amp;#039;Heartland&amp;#039; produced by Youth (Verve, Killing Joke) and Stephen Hague (Pet Shop Boys, New Order) will be released on March 21st, 2007 in Germany via Out Of Line and on April 10th, 2007 in the USA via Metropolis. A sultry,sexy electro pop trio needs a sultry, sexy electro pop album, and &amp;#039;Heartland&amp;#039; is just that. Teasing beats, grooving melodies, fishnet hooks, and sweet seducing vocals thoroughly describe Client and Heartland to a T. Rock and electronic DJs are going to be hard pressed to find just one dance floor track, for the whole album is laden with them. From the happy Drive to bouncy Lights Go Out to the rocking Zerox Machine and the 60&amp;#039;s go-go-esque 6 In The Morning, Client have covered all of the bases to make sure they arenÃƒÂ¢??t thought of as just another pretty face","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11b0ba44b3dbcc0561bb07af6e401ecbf6f99f0a","amp;dn":"Client+-+2007+-+Heartland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11b0ba44b3dbcc0561bb07af6e401ecbf6f99f0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,176,186,68,179,219,204,5,97,187,7,175,110,64,30,203,246,249,159,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
