It was released on March 10, 2009 through G7 Welcoming Committee Records and Smallman Records in Canada and North America,[1][2][3] Hassle Records in the UK and Europe,[4] and Grand Hotel van Cleef in Germany.[5] It is the first Propagandhi release with second guitarist David &quot;The Beaver&quot; Guillas and the first not released on former long time label Fat Wreck Chords. It is the third Propagandhi release on their own label and the first on Smallman Records. The album was recorded at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado.[6]\n\nIn part to stop or impede the leaking of the album, the band set up a page with an option to receive two high-quality songs from the album before release, by donating as little as $1 to one of three activist organizations supported by the band. This page also links to various pre-orders of the album.[7] The band uploaded the entire album onto their MySpace page on March 3, 2009 for fans to hear ahead of its release.[8] The album was critically acclaimed and was voted by punknews.org users as the best album of 2009.[9]\n\nThe artwork is by Canadian artist Kent Monkman, entitled The Triumph of Mischief.\n\n\nTrack-list:\n\n1.\tNight Letters\n2.\tSupporting Caste  \n3.\tTertium Non Datur  \n4.\tDear Coach's Corner  \n5.\tThis Is Your Life  \n6.\tHuman(e) Meat ((The Flensing of Sandor Katz))\n7.\tPotemkin City Limits  \n8.\tThe Funeral Procession  \n9.\tWithout Love  \n10.\tIncalculable Effects  \n11.\tThe Banger's Embrace  \n12.\tLast Will &amp; Testament  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e90f26e873ff593b916901b3ca7b3644249789a","amp;dn":"Propagandhi+-+Supporting+Caste+%282009%29+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e90f26e873ff593b916901b3ca7b3644249789a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,144,242,110,135,63,245,147,185,22,144,27,60,167,179,100,66,73,120,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
