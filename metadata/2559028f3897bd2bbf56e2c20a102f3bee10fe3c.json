Carver based on the screenplay written by Ronald D. Moore.\n\nRead by Jonathan Davis.\n\nThis audiobook is based on the exciting, suspenseful miniseries. Humanity created the robotic cylons to help itself, but the cylons turned on their makers and fought a terrible war until the armistice. Forty years later, the cylons are different. Now they look and act human...and some of them even think they are human. When the cylons attack the twelve human worlds, only a single ship survives the onslaught to protect refugees from those worlds: the oldest ship in the fleet, the Battlestar Galactica. Led by Commander Adama and President Laura Roslin, and pilots like the fiercely independent Starbuck and Lee Adama, they fight for the survival of humanity in a riveting interstellar adventure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2559028f3897bd2bbf56e2c20a102f3bee10fe3c","amp;dn":"Battlestar+Galactica+MiniSeries+Novelization+Audio+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2559028f3897bd2bbf56e2c20a102f3bee10fe3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,89,2,143,56,151,189,43,191,86,226,194,10,16,47,59,238,16,254,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
