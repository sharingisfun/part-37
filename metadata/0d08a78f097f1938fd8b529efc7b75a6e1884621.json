It charts the way these men (and a few women) were recruited, how they operated, what they looked like and what their prospects were. In the process the book attempts to strip away many of the myths associated with piracy, to reveal the harsh realities of life beyond the normal bounds of society. The book draws on decades of research into the subject, and pulls together information from a myriad of sources, including official reports, contemporary newspaper reports, trial proceedings and court testimony, last words on the scaffold, letters, diaries and period scandal sheets. Other sources include archaeological evidence, and relevant objects and artefacts from museum collections on both sides of the Atlantic. In other words the book will reflect the last word in pirate research, making it beneficial to both the serious pirate historian and the novice apprentice.\n\nOsprey Publishing 2011\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d08a78f097f1938fd8b529efc7b75a6e1884621","amp;dn":"Pirates%3A++The+Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d08a78f097f1938fd8b529efc7b75a6e1884621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,8,167,143,9,127,25,56,253,139,82,158,252,123,117,166,225,136,70,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
