So for those of you turned off by such things, we'll skip those kinds of superlatives, because this record should not be missed. In a genre that on the surface seems to be progressing, but in reality is becoming staler every year, Dan Bern's take on folk music is refreshing to say the least. Bern doesn't treat the music with kid gloves, nor does he try to beautify or jazz it up. So don't listen to those anointing him with phrases like &quot;the next Dylan&quot; or &quot;the best singer/songwriter in years&quot;; just listen to Dan Bern's and see for yourself. \nRating 8.7/10\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Hoody.flac\n02 - Merle, Hank and Johnny.flac\n03 - Welcome.flac\n04 - Lifeline.flac\n05 - Turn on a Dime.flac\n06 - Terra Haute.flac\n07 - Late Show.flac\n08 - World.flac\n09 - Waffle House.flac\n10 - One Piece at a Time.flac\n11 - Sky.flac\n\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Indie-Folk\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~702-919 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a702ae212f2b69d86fd88d1b7453e1bafb9e518c","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Dan+Bern+-+Hoody+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a702ae212f2b69d86fd88d1b7453e1bafb9e518c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,2,174,33,47,43,105,216,111,216,141,27,116,83,225,186,251,158,81,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
