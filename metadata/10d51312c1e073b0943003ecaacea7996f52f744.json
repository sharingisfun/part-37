Or perhaps it\nrefers to their distinctive synthesis between composition and improvisation,\narrangement and spontaneity. In any case, this fine CD is their second release,\nrecorded in the studio during the course of a short UK tour in spring 2009. The\nnine tunes include originals by each member along with Leroy JenkinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Albert\nAyler (His Life Was Too Short)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kudala,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a traditional South African\nsong. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a band that truly understands how to ride the edge of\ninside/outside, at times dulcetly melodic, at other times quite prickly; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re\nalways doing something unexpected, weaving their way through collective\ncounterpoint, lyrical solos, and bracing free interludes, as well. Early\nEllington is a strong influence, and you can hear that the bandmembers have\nlearned much from ongoing work with musicians like Braxton, Evan Parker, Lol\nCoxhill, and Joe McPhee, but they all have forged distinctive voices on their\ninstruments. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope this long-distance Trans-Atlantic relationship\ncontinues, as this is a group that deserves to be more than an occasional\nproject.\n\n--\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10d51312c1e073b0943003ecaacea7996f52f744","amp;dn":"The+Convergence+Quartet+-+Song.+Dance+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10d51312c1e073b0943003ecaacea7996f52f744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,213,19,18,193,224,115,176,148,48,3,236,170,206,167,153,111,82,247,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
