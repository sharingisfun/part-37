Like his father and grandfather, he wants to maintain tight control over what North Koreans see of the world - and what the world sees of North Korea. But with unique access, FRONTLINE goes inside the secret state to explore life under its new ruler, and investigate the enigmatic &quot;Morning Star King&quot; as he tries to hold onto power. Using new footage smuggled from inside and never-before-told stories from recent defectors living in South Korea, the film offers a rare glimpse of how some North Koreans are defying authority in a country where just being caught with illegal DVDs could mean immediate imprisonment.
