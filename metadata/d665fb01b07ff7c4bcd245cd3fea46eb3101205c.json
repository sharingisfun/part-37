Not even close.\nSection 407 is all the way up in line with the ending of the\nfloor. Fortunately I managed to move down from the second to last\nrow which was considerably higher up than row J. Since this show\nis what it is I assume most can live without perfection for\nawhile. I&amp;#039;m sure better sources will turn up but this is\nlistenable and will give you a great feel for the show.\n\n1. Security was lax to say the least. They checked tickets and\nwristbands and felt through outer pockets but nothing serious. No\nmetaldetectors. Funniest thing all night was a x-ray (airport\nluggage model) machine standing in the middle of the floor where\nyou picked up your tickets. They made som people put their bags\nthrough while there was a 100 feet or more free passage around it\nwhere 99% just walked through.\n\n2. There were a few empty seats here and there. Most were probably\njust people walking around or going to the bathroom but a few were\nempty all night. That&amp;#039;s how we managed to move down about 15 rows\nfrom the second to last row under the ceiling.\n\n3. I normally boycott these big shows so I don&amp;#039;t know how common\nit is with big screens in this quality. From where we were sitting\nit made a huge difference to the show. It was also a well used\nscreen. Obviously different themes and old footage had been\nselected in advance and it was well executed. The screen was as\nwide as a European hockey rink plus a few meters. Very big.\n\n4. The opening acts all used Bill Wymans Rhythm Kings as house\nband. This meant they were all done in about 70 minutes. While\nthat was about 60 min to long for most it was still brief enough\nfor most to live thru.\n\n5. There was not a single t-shirt available after the show. Most\nwere gone before the show. The huge merchandise booth lookied\nfunny with the walls almost empty. Obviously they had sold the\nshirts pinned to the wall as ads. This must have been the biggest\ngrossing merchandise per visitor ever.\n\n6. I got my ticket through the lottery but not until about 10 days\nbefore the show. Was probably among the last that got in.\n\n7. I obviously put alot of thought into taping or not taping. I\nguess I just figured that with all the attention given to the\nticket situation they would have had little time to deal with\nextra security. I was right about that. My rig is very stealthy as\nwell so it wasn&amp;#039;t that hard. I&amp;#039;ve never been caught in hundreds of\ntaping situations so it would have been bad luck if it had\nhappened this time though.\n\n8. I would like to give props again to butterking and the JEMS HQ.\nAlso to calrust for coming up with my nick. I think his suggestion\nwas slowtrade. Have no idea why :-) Finally, although I don&amp;#039;t know\nhim personally a special thanks to persic for all the fantastic\ntorrents the last couple of years.\n\nRipper Notes:\nOoops, Look at me, appearently I&amp;#039;m taking full credit again by\nproperly encoding to vbr and taggin this rip while adding who\ntaped this show, and his taping information. You bootlegers who\ncomplain are so pethetic, get over yourself, I will never stop, so\nshut up about it.\n\nQuality Rating: A- (Distant)\nEnjoy another quality release from Xplicit Bootlegs!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d665fb01b07ff7c4bcd245cd3fea46eb3101205c","amp;dn":"Led_Zeppelin-Live_In_London_England_1210-2CD-%28Bootleg%29-2007-XB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d665fb01b07ff7c4bcd245cd3fea46eb3101205c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,101,251,1,176,127,247,196,188,210,69,205,63,234,70,235,49,1,32,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
