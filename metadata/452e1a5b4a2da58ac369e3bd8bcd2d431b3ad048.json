Henry Hill is a local boy turned gangster in a neighborhood full of the roughest and toughest. Tommy Devito is a pure bred gangster, who turns out to be Henry\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s best friend. Jimmy Conway puts the two of them together, and runs some of the biggest hijacks and burglaries the town has ever seen. After an extended jail sentence, Henry must sneak around the back of the local mob boss, Paulie Cicero, to live the life of luxury he has always dreamed of. In the end, the friends end up in a hell of a jam, and must do anything they can to save each other, and stay alive.\n\nRipped by Aminos MY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:452e1a5b4a2da58ac369e3bd8bcd2d431b3ad048","amp;dn":"Goodfellas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"452e1a5b4a2da58ac369e3bd8bcd2d431b3ad048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,46,26,91,74,45,165,138,195,105,227,189,139,205,45,67,27,58,208,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
