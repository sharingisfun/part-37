Manbei Kohayagawa (Ganjiro Nakamura) has a rich life on three different fronts. He is the head of a brewery that is having problems at the moment, the head of a family in which one widowed daughter needs his help in finding a new mate and the other needs him to help her make the right choice in a future spouse. Manbei has a strong devil-may-care streak and his solution to his burdens at the moment is to look up his old mistress and resume a relationship with her. His decision has unexpected consequences for himself and his family.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055052/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055052/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-8779&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-8779&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFormat : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.30 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 811 Kbps\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1853/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 1 610 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.379\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.226\n      Stream size : 1.16 GiB (89%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.0 (UTC 2005-11-22)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 142 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a760bbb630f5393f63ea27b480737c43ef41601f","amp;dn":"Kohayagawa-ke+no+aki+%281961+Yasujir%C3%83%C2%B4+Ozu+JAP+no+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a760bbb630f5393f63ea27b480737c43ef41601f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,96,187,182,48,245,57,63,99,234,39,180,128,115,124,67,239,65,96,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
