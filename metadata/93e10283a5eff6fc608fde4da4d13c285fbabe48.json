It was later released in the US on 1 February 1988. The album was recorded at the Miraval Studio in Le Val, France, in between August and September 1987.\n\nThe album was the band's biggest-selling album of new material since For Those About to Rock We Salute You, being certified Platinum in the US. Blow Up Your Video reached #2 in the UK and #12 in the US. However, the band played four tracks from it on the subsequent world tour, &quot;Heatseeker&quot;, &quot;That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot;, &quot;Nick of Time&quot; and &quot;Go Zone&quot;. &quot;Heatseeker&quot; and &quot;That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot; are also featured on AC/DC Live Collector's Edition. &quot;Heatseeker&quot; was a top 20 hit in the UK. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series. During the Blow Up Your Video world tour, Malcolm Young decided not to participate in touring, in order to get over an alcohol addiction. Filling in for him was Malcolm and Angus' nephew, Stevie Young, although Malcolm is present in the Blow Up Your Video promotional videos. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental in 1989, but lost to Jethro Tull's Crest of a Knave.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Malcolm Young, Angus Young and Brian Johnson. \n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\n\n1. \t&quot;Heatseeker&quot;   \t3:50\n2. \t&quot;That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot;   \t3:45\n3. \t&quot;Meanstreak&quot;   \t4:08\n4. \t&quot;Go Zone&quot;   \t4:26\n5. \t&quot;Kissin' Dynamite&quot;   \t3:58\n6. \t&quot;Nick of Time&quot;   \t4:16\n7. \t&quot;Some Sin for Nuthin'&quot;   \t4:11\n8. \t&quot;Ruff Stuff&quot;   \t4:28\n9. \t&quot;Two's Up&quot;   \t5:19\n10. \t&quot;This Means War&quot;   \t4:21\n\nTwo additional songs, &quot;Snake Eye&quot; and &quot;Borrowed Time&quot;, were recorded but only released on the 12-inch single versions of &quot;Heatseeker&quot; and &quot;That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot;, respectively. &quot;Snake Eye&quot; was also included on the 3-inch CD-single for &quot;Heatseeker&quot;. The song &quot;Down On The Borderline&quot; was recorded, but not released until 1990, as the B-side of the Australian &quot;Moneytalks&quot; single in 7-inch, 12-inch and CD-single formats. All three of these songs were later included on Backtracks in 2009. Demo tracks for the songs &quot;Let it Loose&quot; and &quot;Alright Tonight&quot; were stolen and bootlegged, and therefore, omitted from the final album cut.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nExtension File Format: mp3\n\nBitrate: 128 kbps\n\n\nREAPER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93e10283a5eff6fc608fde4da4d13c285fbabe48","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC.Blow+Up+Your+Video.1988.Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93e10283a5eff6fc608fde4da4d13c285fbabe48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,225,2,131,165,239,246,252,96,143,222,77,164,209,60,40,95,186,190,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
