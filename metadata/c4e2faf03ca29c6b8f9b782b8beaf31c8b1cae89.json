Her yearly appearances at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland were not only highlights of the festival weekend, but were also usually released as live albums. Backed with her usual accompanists during this era, the Tommy Flanagan Trio, Fitzgerald runs through a spirited set, opening with a sassy &quot;Too Close For Comfort&quot; and continuing through nine other gems. Highlights include a delightful version of Antonio Carlos Jobim&amp;#039;s &quot;One Note Samba,&quot; a dramatic &quot;My Man,&quot; and the extended scat workout &quot;Billie&amp;#039;s Bounce,&quot; though the version of Stevie Wonder&amp;#039;s &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot; closing the set is strangely tame.\n\nPersonnel: \nElla Fitzgerald (vocals)\nTommy Flanagan (piano)\nKeter Betts (bass)\nBobby Durham (drums)\n\nRecorded at The Montreux Jazz Festival, Montreux, Switzerland on July 14, 1977. \n\nTrack  Listing:\n1.Too Close For Comfort\n2.I Ain&amp;#039;t Got Nothin&amp;#039; But The Blues\n3.My Man\n4.Come Rain Or Come Shine\n5.Day By Day\n6.Ordinary Fool\n7.One Note Samba\n8.I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart\n9.Billie&amp;#039;s Bounce\n10.You Are The Sunshine Of My Life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4e2faf03ca29c6b8f9b782b8beaf31c8b1cae89","amp;dn":"Ella+Fitzgerald+%26+Tommy+Flanagan+Trio+-+Montreux+%5C%2777+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4e2faf03ca29c6b8f9b782b8beaf31c8b1cae89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,226,250,240,60,162,156,107,143,155,120,43,139,234,243,28,139,28,174,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
