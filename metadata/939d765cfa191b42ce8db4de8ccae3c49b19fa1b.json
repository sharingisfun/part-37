The weapons used were alleged to have been stationary and/or mobile gas chambers, poison gases of both fast acting and slow acting varieties, unslaked lime, superheated steam, electricity, diesel exhaust fumes, etc. Holocaust historians alleged that bodies were piled as high as multistoried buildings and burned without a trace, using little or no fuel. Graf and Mattogno have now analyzed the origins, logic and technical feasibility of the official version of Treblinka. On the basis of numerous documents they reveal Treblinka's true identity: it was a transit camp. Even longtime Revisionism buffs will find a lot that is new in this book, while Graf's animated style guarantees a pleasant reading experience. The original testimony of witnesses enlivens the reader, as does the skill with which the authors expose the absurdities of Holocaust historiography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:939d765cfa191b42ce8db4de8ccae3c49b19fa1b","amp;dn":"Treblinka%3A+Extermination+Camp+or+Transit+Camp%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"939d765cfa191b42ce8db4de8ccae3c49b19fa1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,157,118,92,250,25,27,66,206,141,180,222,140,202,227,196,155,25,250,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
