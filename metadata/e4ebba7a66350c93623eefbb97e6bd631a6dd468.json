Far from the traditional conservative image of country music this album features songs about female empowerment as well as a number of radical subjects - Prostitution, abortion, death and angels, workplace sexual exploitation, small town bigotry and more. As well as the extensive sleevenotes the accompanying large outsize booklet in card slipcase also includes stunning photography from the Getty picture archive and also includes new interviews with a number of the featured artists.
