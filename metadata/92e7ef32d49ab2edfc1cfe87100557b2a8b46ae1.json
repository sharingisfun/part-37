The components of language are explained in easy-to-understand terms and the progression of the language from Germanic to Old, Middle, and Modern English is fully illustratedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including such revolutionary language upheavals as those brought about by the Norman Conquest and the Great Vowel Shift. \n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the English language lies in its variants, such as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsodaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ vs. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ debate and the place of African-American English in modern culture. These and other dialectual curiosities are looked at in detail and placed in the context of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s world. Finally, Professor Drout examines the future not only of the English language, but of all the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s languages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92e7ef32d49ab2edfc1cfe87100557b2a8b46ae1","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+English+Language+%28TMS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92e7ef32d49ab2edfc1cfe87100557b2a8b46ae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,231,239,50,212,154,178,237,252,28,254,135,16,5,87,178,168,180,106,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
