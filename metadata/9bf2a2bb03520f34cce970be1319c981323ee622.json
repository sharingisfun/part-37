The mission, codenamed Damocles, is to attack key Smoke Jaguar installations on the planet Tranquil, including a &amp;#039;Mech Factory, a starport and a geothermal power plant, and to eliminate Smoke Jaguar forces and leadership on planet.\n\nTwo dropships are deployed to release the multi-lance BattleMech force to destroy these installations. However, while in orbit above Tranquil, a dropship is attacked by massive naval laser fire. The Blackhammer is shot down and the remaining dropship, The Eclipse, retreats to safety. The player (referred to only as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlance leaderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) had already been deployed from the Blackhammer slightly off target before it was shot down. The Mobile Field Bases (MFB) that had been deployed with the player land on target, and the player meets up with them quickly.\n\nIt is quickly apparent that the original plan is no longer viable- less than half of the &amp;#039;Mechs are deployed, with the rest either shot down during the drop or still on-board the Eclipse. Despite this setback, the player must continue with his objectives, and hope to link up with those forces that survived, and eventually, secure a landing zone so the dropship can return to evacuate them.\n\nMechwarrior has several compatibility issues with Windows XP, leading the game to freeze or crash. These issues can be addressed by changing the compatibility setting for the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bf2a2bb03520f34cce970be1319c981323ee622","amp;dn":"Mechwarrior+3+with+NOcd+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bf2a2bb03520f34cce970be1319c981323ee622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,242,162,187,3,82,15,52,204,233,112,190,19,25,201,129,50,62,230,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
