The complete text is less than 1200 characters, but in that limited space it manages to enumerate all of the salient features of the Confucian tradition. Children were required to memorize it even before they could read and write. Written in the thirteenth century and usually attributed to Wang Yinglin (1223-1296), a renowned Confucian scholar, during the Song Dynasty.\n\nSide-by-side translations by Herbert Giles (1900,1910) &amp; J.
