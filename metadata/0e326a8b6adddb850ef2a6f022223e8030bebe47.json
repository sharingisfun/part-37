Pollan proposes a new answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Pollan's bracing and eloquent manifesto shows us how we can start making thoughtful food choices that will enrich our lives, enlarge our sense of what it means to be healthy, and bring pleasure back to eating.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e326a8b6adddb850ef2a6f022223e8030bebe47","amp;dn":"In+Defense+of+Food","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e326a8b6adddb850ef2a6f022223e8030bebe47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,50,106,139,106,221,219,133,14,242,166,240,34,34,62,128,48,190,190,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
