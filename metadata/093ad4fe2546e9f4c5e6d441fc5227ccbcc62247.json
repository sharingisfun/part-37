Managed (like the Beatles) by Brian Epstein, Gerry Marsden and his band burst out of the gate with three consecutive number one U.K. hits in 1963, &quot;How Do You Do It,&quot; &quot;I Like It,&quot; and &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone.&quot; If the Beatles defined Merseybeat at its best in early 1963, Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers defined the form at its most innocuous, performing bouncy, catchy, and utterly lightweight tunes driven by rhythm guitar and Marsden's chipper vocals. Compared to the Beatles and other British Invasion heavies, they sound quaint indeed. That's not to say the group were trivial; their hits were certainly likable and energetic and are fondly remembered today, even if the musicians lacked the acumen (or earthy image) to develop their style from its relentlessly upbeat and poppy base. ....\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wiftxqe5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wiftxqe5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music has an empty page here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:aifqxqu5ldje&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:aifqxqu5ldje&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA review from http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/palms/6315/cdlist.htm:\n\nThe British version of The Defnintive Collection, this collection re-used the re-mixes for the American release but did not do any fresh remixes of the twintrack recordings not on its transatlantic counterpart. On song selection, this collection is stronger than Definitive, as such great rockers as &quot;Slow Down&quot;, &quot;A Shot of R&amp;B&quot; and &quot;Why oh Why&quot; and balance the ballads and pop songs that dominate the American collection. If the compilers could have dropped a couple of the inessential B-sides and worked in a couple of the live tracks from Gerry In California, this collection would have blown all others out of the water. As it is, this is probably my favourite compilation on song selection alone, narrowly edging out At Abbey Road. \n\nTrack List:\n\n01. How Do You Do It\n02. Maybellene\n03. I Like It\n04. Chills\n05.
