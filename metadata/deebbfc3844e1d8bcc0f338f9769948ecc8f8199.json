Written by one of the most experienced and well-known names in science writing, it is also assuredly reliable science. Although arranged for convenience and quick reference as a collection of topics in alphabetical order, it is very different from any conventional encyclopedia. Each topic tells a story, making the book eminently browsable. Packed with information, yet carrying its immense learning lightly, this is a book that would appeal to anyone with the slightest interest in how the world works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deebbfc3844e1d8bcc0f338f9769948ecc8f8199","amp;dn":"Magic+Universe+-+A+Grand+Tour+of+Modern+Science+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deebbfc3844e1d8bcc0f338f9769948ecc8f8199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,235,191,195,132,78,29,139,204,15,51,143,151,105,148,142,204,143,129,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
