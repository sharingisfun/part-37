And it's all the fault of that evil, soul-hopping spirit that took over his head. Or maybe the other four people in there.\n\nRichard Coldiron journeys through a troubled childhood, where he meets his invisible friend, his other invisible friend...and then some who arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t so friendly. \n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mister Milktoast, the protective punster; Little Hitler, who leers from the shadows; Loverboy, the lusty bastard; and Bookworm, who is thoughtful, introspective, and determined to solve the riddle of RichardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disintegration into either madness or genius, and of course only makes things worse. They reside in the various rooms of his skull, a place known as the Bone House. And the people outside his head aren't so comforting, either--little Sally, his hapless mother, his cruel dad, and a misfit teen named Virginia who also hears voices.\n\nRichard keeps his cool despite the voices in his head, but heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about to get a new tenant: the Insider, a malevolent soul-hopping spirit that may or may not be born from RichardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nightmares and demands a co-writing credit and a little bit of foot-kissing dark worship.\n\nNow Richard doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know which voice to trust. The bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been rejected 117 times. The people he loves keep turning up dead. And here comes the woman of his dreams.\n\n----\nA dark romantic thriller in the style of Chuck Palahniuk, Jeff Lindsay's &quot;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&quot; series, and Bret Easton Ellis.\n\nScott Nicholson,, is author of 12 other paranormal, mystery, and suspense thrillers, including the #1 Kindle bestsellers LIQUID FEAR, DISINTEGRATION, THE RED CHURCH, and THE SKULL RING.
