His father, Claudus, does not feel his son is ready, being too lenient and easily distracted by flights of fancy like the myth of ancient technology. Soon after, King Claudus welcomes the return of his friend Grune and holds a celebration in both his honor and in memory of the fallen Panthro. During the event, Lion-O defends a pair of captured Lizards and convinces his father to release them.\nNOTE: This episode was once titled &quot;The Sword of Omens&quot;. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 2-Omens (Part 2) [U.S. Original Airdate- July 29, 2011]\n\nThe next day, Thundera is attacked by Lizards who have acquired salvaged technology. It is soon discovered that Grune has joined the Lizards, and that Panthro is being held hostage. Lion-O comes to his father's aid, allowing Claudus to rescue Panthro. But Panthro murders the king, then revealing himself to be Mumm-Ra, an ancient nemesis of the Thundercats, in disguise. Lion-O and Tygra are captured along with Jaga and Cheetara. However, due to his kindess to the Lizard prisoners, Lion-O was given a key hidden in his meal, allowing him to escape with Tygra to mount a rescue. Mumm-Ra wants the stone in the sword which he claims is his, and tortures Jaga to get him to remove a curse that prevents evil from touching the Sword of Omens. Lion-O and Tygra rescue Jaga and Cheetara, who is now revealed to be one of JagaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clerics, with Lion-O grabbing the sword to blast Mumm-Ra out into open as the rising sun's rays harm him. Forced to leave Jaga, who sacrifices himself to ensure their escape, Lion-O, Tygra, and Cheetara undertake the quest to find the Book of Omens.\nNOTE: This episode was once titled &quot;Ancient Spirits of Evil&quot;. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 3-Ramlak Rising [U.S. Original Airdate- August 5, 2011]\n\nFollowing the events of the previous night, Lion-O, Cheetara, and Tygra hold a funeral pyre for King Claudus, with Lion-O etching the Thundercats symbol into the broken statue of his father. Determined to get revenge on Mumm-Ra, Lion-O sets out for the Sea of Sands with a reluctant Cheetara and Tygra in tow. As they leave Thundera, WilyKit and WilyKat approach the trio, asking to join in the journey until they find El Dara. Lion-O refuses, but the twins follow anyway. They reach a desert-like ocean, but are captured by a boat crewed by a group of Fishmen. Their captain, Koinelius Tunar, is obsessed with tracking down and killing a creature called Ramlak, which sucked up the waters of the Fishmen's homeland. Lion-O begins to succumb to his own obsession, helping Tunar track down the creature despite the protests of Tygra and Cheetara alike. Eventually the Ramlak snags the ship with it's tentacles and tears it to pieces, forcing Lion-O to forget his obsession and save everyone from drowning, while Tunar dies as he makes one final strike at Ramlak. Once everyone is safe, Lion-O is seemingly devoured by Ramlak, only to cut his way out with the Sword of Omens, releasing the stolen waters from it's body. With their home restored, the Fishmen bid the group farewell, and Lion-O accepts the twins into the group after seeing their capability in battle. At Mumm-Ra's pyramid, it is revealed that Jaga is still alive, but now a prisoner inside a dark magic lantern, which Mumm-Ra claims will lead him to the Book of Omens.\nNOTE: The episode's plot is an homage to Moby Dick, with the captain of the vessel obsessively hunting the Ramlak. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 4-Song of the Petalars [U.S. Original Airdate- August 12, 2011]\n\nAs the Lizards keep getting closer to the Thundercats, Lion-O questions if they're fighting a losing battle. When they see a small armada catching up, they hide in a thorn-bush forest where they meet the Petalars. The Petalars have lived in the forest since their ancestors were swept there by a powerful wind. Lion-O meets a young boy, Emrick, who wants be a hero like him. The Thundercats join the Petalars in their journey to the Valley of Winds, guided by an ancient map. Lion-O realizes that Emrick ages quickly, after which Cheetara learns that the Petalars live for what is a day to everyone else, but is a lifetime to the Petalars, who do not know or notice this. At the gate to the valley, the group is ambushed by three Lizards. The Petalars, grateful to the Cats for aiding them on their journey, stun the Lizards long enough for the Cats to win. Slythe becomes impatient and orders the forest to be burned down. The ensuing fire cause an updraft allowing the Petalars to ride and escape. Emrick, now a dying old man, thanks Lion-O for being his friend and reminds him that what matters in life is how fully we live, before passing away. Now more confident, Lion-O leads the Thundercats against the Lizards outside the forest. When the Lizards are about to kill them, Panthro arrives in the Thundertank and easily dispatches them. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 5-Old Friends [U.S. Original Airdate- August 19, 2011]\n\nFollowing the Thundercats' rescue by Panthro, Lion-O attempts to start a conversation with him as he makes repairs to the Thundertank. However, Panthro constantly attempts to avoid talking showing little respect for Lion-O's authority. Eventually, Panthro says he needs to get Thundrillium to recharge the Thundertank from a nearby Lizard-controlled mine run by Grune with the aid of the Driller. Initially, Panthro plans on doing it alone, but Lion-O, Tygra and Cheetara volunteer to come along. In response, he tells them not to slow him down. While searching for the Thundrillium, Panthro has flashbacks of his friendship with Grune ranging from meeting on the battlefield and saving Claudus from attacking Lizards, rising through the ranks as officers, being sent to recover the Book of Omens, and Grune's eventual corruption and betrayal to Mumm-Ra, unleashing the villain from his imprisonment. Panthro and Grune eventually meet up in the mine. But before they can have a showdown, the Driller appears to block the Thundercats long enough for Grune to escape. In the course of the battle with Driller, Lion-O uses the Sword of Omens to save Panthro's life and destroy the robot, but all its digging causes the mountain to collapse, with Cheetara only barely getting the Thundrillium they came for. After escaping the mine, Panthro says Lion-O has earned his undying loyalty. But when Lion-O asks if he can drive the Thundertank, Panthro says &quot;Not a chance... my king&quot;. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 6-Journey to the Tower of Omens [U.S. Original Airdate- August 26, 2011]\n\nWhile Lion-O practices with the Sword of Omens, Mumm-Ra forces Jaga to reveal the location of the Tower of Omens; which has the Book of Omens hidden within. In the Jungle, Snarf, while trying to fill his appetite causes a ruckus which reveals the entrance to a temple leading to the Tower. After entering the temple, each member of the Cats solves one of a series of deadly puzzles and reach the Tower's entrance. Lion-O uses the Eye of Thundera and finds a button that opens the way to the Tower of Omens, which Tygra opens with his whip. Mumm-Ra then reaches the Tower, having located it thanks to Jaga. A fierce battle takes place in the tower, during which Mumm-Ra transforms into his muscular winged form, where, just as Mumm-Ra was about to finish Lion-O off, Jaga sacrifices himself to save Lion-O and the others. Soon afterwards, the Cats claim the Book of Omens, where Lion-O discovers it is actually blank. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 7-Legacy [U.S. Original Airdate- September 2, 2011]\n\nAfter recovering the Book of Omens, Lion-O is able to power it up and his soul is sent into the book. Lion-O meets Jaga's spirit, who explains that the book is a fusion of magic and technology, and that the book's laws of life, death, and reality are different, sending Lion-O into the book's data to see how history unfolded through the eyes of his ancestor Leo. In the past, Lion-O discovers that Leo is the commander of the cats, who serve Mumm-Ra as his jailers of the other Animals. Mumm-Ra is after the Warstone, which Lion-O recognizes as the Eye of Thundera. After discovering it's location, Mumm-Ra sends forces to the planet below to recover the stone. At the same time, a riot breaks out in the prison bay. Leo and his second-in-command and girlfriend, Panthera arrest the Jackal and Lizard perpetrators where Lion-O discovers that they are planning a rebellion with the Animals. Leo uses his mages to construct the Sword of Omens and the Gauntlet. Captain Tygus recovers the Warstone, but it is taken by Leo who then proceeds to use it to complete the Sword of Omens. Leo then confronts Mumm-Ra, and learns about three other similar stones, taking one. Mumm-Ra uses the two remaining stones to create a battle armor powered by magic. Leo is able to force Mumm-Ra off the platform, giving him time to free the Animals, inspiring them to fight. Mumm-Ra returns to finish the battle, and seems to be winning, until Leo adds the stone he took to his gauntlet. After the battle, Leo overpowers Mumm-Ra and takes the other two stones, causing Mumm-Ra to become decrepit and old. The ship, damaged by their fight, is hit by a space storm and begins to crash. Mumm-Ra manages to put himself into an emergency capsule, but Leo and Panthera destroy the controls, trapping him inside. Lion-O is pulled out of the simulation, and Jaga reveals that the data had been corrupted by the crash, but there were enough survivors to start civilization. However, the other three stones were lost all over Third-Earth. He realizes that he must find the three stones using the Book of Omens, and unite the Animals once again. Lion-O returns to his body, waking up with the others standing over him concerned. Newly confident, he states that he now knows what they must do.\nTrivia: When Mumm-Ra is telling Leo (Lion-O) that every species has its place, Mon*Star from SilverHawks is featured on the bottom left and a TigerShark from the series TigerSharks is also seen. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 8-The Duelist and the Drifter [U.S. Original Airdate- September 9, 2011]\n\nPanthro and Tygra try to rig the Book of Omens to the ThunderTank, their latest attempt damaging the entire tank. When in a nearby town getting supplies, Lion-O has an encounter with a Drifter who warns him to stay away from the town. Lion-O learns that the town doesn't accept Thunderian currency after what happened to Thundera. Lion-O enters a sword competition to get local currency and wins by slicing the stone block in half with the Sword of Omens. He soon gets challenged by the Duelist (a professional swordsman who collects the swords of the opponents he has defeated) to a sword match with the Sword of Omens as its wager. The Drifter reveals that the Sword of Hittanzo is the Duelist's best sword (which he claimed from its sword-maker) and learns that the Drifter was the sword's maker and he warns Lion-O that no one can beat his creation. When it comes to the match, the Duelist manages to overcome Lion-O and claim the Sword of Omens. Afterwards, Lion-O ends up gaining the unlikely assistance of the Drifter to make another sword. Once the sword is forged, Lion-O seeks out the Duelist at a nearby tavern and challenges him to a rematch for all of Duelist's swords with Duelist wanting Lion-O to put up his life as well. During the rematch, Lion-O does his best to evade the Duelist's attacks until the Duelist breaks Lion-O's sword. Upon following the Drifter's &quot;willows are weak&quot; philosophy, Lion-O uses this wisdom to disarm Duelist of his swords. Drifter says that he has what he needed to win in himself. When Duelist tries to attack Lion-O, the Drifter manages to successfully knock down the Duelist and send him out of town. Before going their separate ways, Drifter tells Lion-O that he will return the swords to their rightful owners. Lion-O reunites with Tygra and Panthro who wondered what took him so long.\n\n\n-----------------------Episode 9-Berbils [U.S. Original Airdate- October 28, 2011]\n\nTiny robot bears called Berbils solicit the help of the ThunderCats to save them from a slave trader named Conquedor who values their technical and construction skills. The Cats also decide to help rescue the enslaved Berbils and defend their village. Meanwhile, Panthro learns that he's not the only &quot;wrench monkey&quot; in the group when he bonds with Ro-Bear-Bill. Especially when they come up with a way to drive away the Conquedor, the Trollogs, and the Giantors. Later, WilyKit and WilyKat discover Candy Fruit, which appears to give them a sugar rush, helping them in the fight. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 10-Sight Beyond Sight [U.S. Original Airdate- November 4, 2011]\n\nWhile driving through the desert, Panthro tells Lion-O that the Book of Omens has detected one of the three magical stones. During a race between the Thunder Tank, Lion-O, Tygra, and Cheetara, Wilykit and Wilykat accidentally sets off the missiles which they evade. Upon arriving outside a giant temple, the ThunderCats end up meeting a group of Elephants led by Aburn and Anet where they ask where the magical stone is. Under the suggestion of Anet, Lion-O ends up using the Sword of Omens' power and is told that he must be in harmony with it. During the training, the Elephants' village is attacked by the insect-like Wraiths who are after their harvest. Following the Wraiths attack, Anet states that they have some food left to harvest. Ahnet tells Lion-O to be in harmony with the Sword of Omens and vows to get the stolen harvest back. When Wilykit is playing her flute, Aburn and Wilykat end up joining in on her performance which attracts the attention of the other Elephants who join in as well. Meanwhile, Lion-O climbs up a cliff leading to the Wraith's lair and loses his grip when they attack. Luckily, Lion-O uses his Claw to grip onto the side of the cliff as the Wraiths swarm all over him. He dives into a hole in a cliff and ends up discovering that the hole is actually their hive. Upon getting out, he uses the Sword of Omens to seal the cave in order to keep them out. Just then, a Stone Giant awakens and finds some dead Wraiths. Later that night, Lion-O returns and learns from Anet that the &quot;universe is out of tune&quot; and that their sounds is what kept the Stone Giant away. While the Elephants meditate, the ThunderCats do battle with the Stone Giant where they discover with every attack, the Stone Giant reassembles. Upon trapping the Cats, the Stone Giant attacks the Elephants' village and starts eating the stone structures. Wilykit and the Elephants end up playing music loud enough for the Stone Giant to crumble. As the Elephants rebuild their village, Anet puts Lion-O through his harmony training again and is able to use the Sword of Omens' power to find one of the magical stones in a nearby hut. When the magical stone isn't seen there, Anet tells the ThunderCats to go to the Forest of Magi Oar in order to amplify the Sword of Omens' power. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 11-The Forest of Magi Oar [U.S. Original Airdate- November 11, 2011]\n\nWhen in the Forest of Magi Oar, the ThunderCats send WilyKit, WilyKat and Snarf to search for firewood. After they return, they start a fire and lay down to rest. Lion-O confronts Tygra on his frustrations with the Sword of Omens not working. Tygra then implies that Lion-O is not the right person for the sword and shows his jealousy towards Lion-O's confrontations with Cheetara. Lion-O throws a piece of firewood into the fire that releases several assumingly evil spirits around them. After the ThunderCats cannot defeat them, they meet the Wood Forgers, who have a talent of using paper magic in combat. The Wood Forgers led by Zigg lead them back to their home where they have a School of Paper Arts and a paper mill. They tell Lion-O of a monster bird known as Viragor. The ThunderCats come to their aid when the Forest of Magi Oar is threatened by Viragor, and Cheetara loses her staff to the monster. Tygra manages to save her, which Cheetara seems surprised. Lion-O gets captured by the monster and abandons the Sword of Omens. Viragor then explains to Lion-O that he has protected the forest for decades and the Wood Forgers are slowly destroying the forest. He also learns that he couldn't use his sword against the spirits because it can only be used to defeat evil, suggesting that the spirits were friendly. Lion-O returns on Viragor to tell the rest of the ThunderCats the truth, much to the Wood Forgers' disappointment. They then begin to fight, and after a few minutes, Lion-O and Viragor crash into the forest. Lion-O finally regains use of his sword and defeats Zigg. Viragor also makes Cheetara a new staff out of Magi Oar wood. Lion-O then uses sight beyond sight and finally finds the stone's next location. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 12-Into the Astral Plane [U.S. Original Airdate- November 18, 2011]\n\nThe ThunderCats travel back to the Elephants' village in the ThunderTank, following the true trail to the next stone's location. On the way, Lion-O, Cheetara, and Tygra try to explain what the astral planes are to Panthro. Lion-O says he &quot;finally has the hang of&quot; his sword, and Cheetara congratulates him saying there is a reason the sword chose him. Lion-O then states &quot;it's probably the same reason she will chose me&quot; after Cheetara goes into the tank. Tygra then mutters to himself &quot;And just like the sword, it's one more thing you don't deserve.&quot; Tygra thinks back to when he was a young guard attempting to help a young Cheetara find where the clerics reside. Cheetara gets to the building and is let in by Jaga, but he tells her to work on her patience before she tries to be a cleric and rejects her. Tygra's thoughts end and they stop near the village to find that it has been taken over by Grune's forces. Grune is frustrated and annoyed by the elephants forgetfulness when they keep telling him that the stone is in the hut. He gives them until the third moon rises to tell him how to get the stone. Meanwhile, Lion-O and Cheetara plan to wait until nightfall to use stealth to attack Grune and the lizards. Tygra, however, thinks they should attack as soon as possible and use the tank, but eventually go with Lion-O and Cheetara's plan. This leads into a flashback with Cheetara still sitting outside of the clerics' building. She smiles at Tygra, which gives him the confidence to approach her before being interrupted by Jaga's arrival and rejection of Cheetara once again. After several more days of rejection, Jaga decides that she has learned patience and welcomes her into the clerics (although she was asleep). The flashback ends, showing the ThunderCats in a field adjacent to the village. Lion-O talks to Cheetara about he and Tygra's competitiveness and worries of the &quot;darkness&quot; within his older brother. She responds that it is probably due to having always lived under his younger brother's shadow. Snarf runs up to the Lizards guarding the village and creates a diversion, leading them straight into Panthro and the fighting soon begins. During the fight, WilyKit and WilyKat go check on the elephants, who notice WilyKit which unintentionally blows their stealth operation. Grune then forces the cats to drop all of their weapons and tell him where the stone is. Lion-O agrees to show him where it is in order to save the elephants, and Tygra disappears, trying to do something on his own. Lion-O opens up the gate to the astral plane with the Sword of Omens. Grune then takes the sword and tells his forces to kill the ThunderCats and the Elephants, but Tygra returns in the tank and rescues them. Lion-O then steals the sword back making Grune and his forces abandon the village and then prepares to enter the astral plane. Cheetara wishes him luck and kisses him on the cheek, making Tygra jealous and insists that he go in the gate as well, claiming the mission is too much for Lion-O to handle alone. Lion-O barely agrees, and lets Tygra enter first, but before Lion-O enters, Anet warns him that he had a vision; Tygra will betray Lion-O before the evening bell. After Lion-O enters, Mumm-Ra (disguised as a crow) goes through the gate as well. \n\n\n-----------------------Episode 13-Between Brothers [U.S. Original Airdate- November 25, 2011]\n\nPanthro scopes out the lizard army and is worried that the Cats are outnumbered and cannot defeat them. Meanwhile, Lion-O and Tygra are searching for the stone in the astral plane. Tygra threatens to keep the stone if he finds it while Mumm-Ra lurks in the background, hoping that the brothers rivalry will lead to their deaths. Panthro explains to WilyKit and WilyKat that Grune lost his tooth when he ripped out his sabertooth while fighting Spidera, a mythical giant spider in her nest. Back in the astral plane, Lion-O and Tygra come across a scene from their childhood where Tygra dared Lion-O to cross a log over a deep pit in the Forbidden Ruins. Lion-O figures out that Tygra broke the log on purpose while he was crossing, and had previously thought it snapped on its own. Tygra gets a faux sword of omens and begins to fight Lion-O over the position of king. Tygra knocks Lion-O into the pit and then remembers that he ran to get help from King Claudus after Lion-O fell in the pit, and swears in the present that he will never betray Lion-O, helping him out of the pit. Back at the village, Cheetara holds off the lizards from entering the astral plane while Panthro fights Grune one-on-one. After meditating, the Elephants finally decide to help fight off the lizards and manage to drive them away. Lion-O and Tygra battle Mumm-Ra in the astral plane and Lion-O discovers that the stone is what holds the astral plane together putting it in his gauntlet. They defeat Mumm-Ra, but the astral plane slowly begins to deteriorate. Panthro, still fighting Grune, forces him into the closing gateway to the astral plane. Grune is sucked into the gate, but so are Panthro's arms. Later, they hold a celebration at the village, where Panthro is shown recovering with Snarf's help. Anet tells Lion-O that Tygra has yet to betray him because the evening bell has yet to ring. Cheetara confesses her feelings to Tygra, remembering his gift, the Day Astrid flower (each petal is said to have trapped a day of life in it) he gave her while she waited outside the Cleric's, giving her strength. She kept the heart of the flower since then in memory of his kindness. They then share a passionate kiss. Unbeknownst to them, Lion-O sees them and is devastated just as the evening bell rings. \n[/i][/b]\n\n[b][color=blue][i]::Trackers::[/i][/color][/b]\n[b][code] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n\n\n[/code][/b]\n[b][color=red]Info Hash[/color]:[i]A627B4EFCF6E350DFE83951CAE33A5B3D38FCC78[/i][/b] \n\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iviUMJIxLUrxz.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ibpZeVD4xZ4PEE.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iEUsGB2TplxB6.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ibddzgtvPrBm7F.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/idpxeFJjZ6wVd.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iyXzMn9tYeK00.gif[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/i5L6lreJeSJT0.png[/img][/center]\n\nWe are now also on FaceBook.
