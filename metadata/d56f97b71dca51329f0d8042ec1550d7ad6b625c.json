Luckily, you don't need to watch episode 8 before episode 9 etc!\n\nWorking long hours and eager to upgrade her starter home, April is looking to buy a new house in the downtown core. The Property Brothers come to the rescue and help her find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time.\n\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d56f97b71dca51329f0d8042ec1550d7ad6b625c","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s03e03.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d56f97b71dca51329f0d8042ec1550d7ad6b625c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,111,151,183,29,202,81,50,159,13,128,66,236,21,80,215,173,107,98,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
