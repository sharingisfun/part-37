Thelma Houston teamed with the band Pressure Cooker in the early &amp;#039;80s, doing a fusion/instrumental pop/R&amp;B/soul work for Sheffield Labs. That affiliation ensured that it would be brilliantly engineered, and it sounded spectacular, especially for an early &amp;#039;80s release. Unfortunately, much of the musical output didn&amp;#039;t match the mastering brilliance, despite an energetic effort from Houston. But her voice was too much for what was basically a warm-up caliber backing group. It would have been great to hear Houston doing these songs supported by The Tower of Power. - All Music Guide\n\nTrack listing:\n1. &quot;I&amp;#039;ve Got the Music In Me&quot;\n2. &quot;Reggae Tune (Instrumental)\n3 . &quot;To Know You This To Love You&quot;\n4. &quot;Pressure Cooker&quot; (Instrumental)\n5. &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Misunderstand&quot;\n6. &quot;Step in Time (Instrumental)\n7. &quot;Dish Rag (Instrumental)\n8. &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;/&quot;I&amp;#039;ve Got the Music In Me&quot; (Reprise)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25f929050baa990dd31da21b7e3fea535530760d","amp;dn":"Thelma+Houston+-+I%5C%27ve+Got+The+Music+In+Me+%281975%29+RESEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25f929050baa990dd31da21b7e3fea535530760d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,249,41,5,11,170,153,13,211,29,162,27,126,63,234,83,85,48,118,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
