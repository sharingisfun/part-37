At this point Electro Spectre was chasing an international signing for the band, and in 2008 the band came really close to sign up with Sony, England. Dispite beeing very close, the signing failed.\n Late 2008 Electro Spectre went back in the studio to record new fresh material for the upcoming album 'Watch It All Turn', as they were dissapointed the initially album recorded in 2007 didn't make it to a release. \nDuring the years Electro Spectre has received many questions why the album was never released, as it was a really strong album. As of this Crab Key Records have desided to release the 2008 album 'Pop Ghost' in it's full as it was recorded then. Untouched! \n This is the very first dark alternative steps Electro Spectre took right at the beginning!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec401cafbba2b9b52704bfd4fc002bf4a22f3843","amp;dn":"Electro+Spectre+-+Pop+Ghost+%28Limited+Deluxe+Edition%29+2013+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec401cafbba2b9b52704bfd4fc002bf4a22f3843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,64,28,175,187,162,185,181,39,4,191,212,252,0,43,244,162,47,56,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
