We mention the dangers of using humidifiers/vaporizers, uses of chlorophyll, the incredible hypocrisy of Whole Foods Market, and why everyone should avoid decaffeinated coffee. We explain why allergies to healthy foods have suddenly become so common, and how to recover. We also provide a plan through which people can cure their bruxism (destructive teeth grinding) and explain why the overwhelming majority of diets are doomed to fail. We also briefly report the ethical problems with 501(c)3 &quot;charities&quot;, how the modern churches are actually employed by the government, and much more. This report is a wild ride, so be sure to buckle up.\n\nFor more information from The Health Wyze Report, visit http://HealthWyze.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da8c75fd7da9759d4a4181401a5fb02a401b289b","amp;dn":"The+Health+Wyze+Report+-+Episode+16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da8c75fd7da9759d4a4181401a5fb02a401b289b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,140,117,253,125,169,117,157,74,65,129,64,26,95,176,42,64,27,40,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
