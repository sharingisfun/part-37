With the lovely Becky (Rebel Wilson) about to marry her handsome boyfriend, Dale (Hayes MacArthur), the remaining members of the institute gang gather for a party last single in the Big Apple. Regan (Kirsten Dunst) is super bridesmaid, secretly upset about not being the first to be home while Lena (Lizzy Caplan) is a sarcastic but also a romantic secret, and Katie (Isla Fisher) is a pretty silly to who loves the good life. But when Becky insists that the bachelorette party is light, the girls set up their own party. Things get wild very fast, with the trio touring Manhattan with a wedding dress torn, flying to a dry cleaner and looking for a tailor, plus bachelor smash Dale. That's where Regan meets her ideal partner in the hedonistic Trevor (James Marsden), Katie is pursued by his former classmate, Joe (Kyle Bornheimer) and Gena is attracted to his old love Clyde (Adam Scott). Will they get the girls through the night alive? Can they fix the dress, be with Becky, and get to the ceremony on time? The clock is ticking, but the single is only beginning what will be a memorable weekend that will change their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ec914cb34c41d8a75713ffe9077d8347dc04aeb","amp;dn":"Bachelorette+%282012%29+%5BMICROHD+720p%5D+%5BDUAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ec914cb34c41d8a75713ffe9077d8347dc04aeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,201,20,203,52,196,29,138,117,113,63,254,144,119,216,52,125,192,74,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
