It was released on October 20, 1998 through No Limit Records and was entirely produced by Beats By the Pound. The album made it high on the Billboard charts, making it to #15 on the Billboard 200 and #3 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, but the group never released a follow-up and have not been heard of since.
