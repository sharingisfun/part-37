With Connectify Hotspot PRO, you can turn your Windows computer into a real Wi-Fi hotspot that shares that single 3G/4G connection with any other Wi-Fi enabled devices. You'll maximize the value of your 3G/4G card and get all your peripherals online at the same time!\n\nOn the Road\nFor the modern traveler, Internet connectivity is a lifeline. Airports, Hotels, and Coffee Shops know this and charge accordingly for Wi-Fi access or only supply you with an ethernet jack, which leaves Wi-Fi only devices and smart phones in the dark. With Connectify Hotspot PRO as your software-only travel router, you can connect to ANY available Internet connection (including 3G, 4G, and mobile broadband), start a hotspot, and get all of your devices online simultaneously, and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nPRO Version Features:\n- Unlimited Hotspot Uptime Ã¢â‚¬â€œ No time restrictions, run your Connectify Hotspot 24/7.\n- Share Wi-Fi from 3G/4G Networks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Connectify Hotspot PRO supports sharing Internet from 3G/4G cards in addition to a wide variety of other USB cards and dongles.
