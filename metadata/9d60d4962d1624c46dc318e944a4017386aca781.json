Here, Tony Bennett pays homage to &quot;the Voice&quot; in a way only he can. This massive, 24-track compilation runs through the list of standards that made Sinatra legendary. &quot;Night and Day,&quot; &quot;East of the Sun (West of the Moon),&quot; and &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot; are just a few of the tracks that Bennett has managed to bring to life just as beautifully as Sinatra did so many years ago. Backed by his standard group, the Ralph Sharon Trio, he manages to make this collection more and more his own. Instead of simply covering the songs, or trying to emulate Sinatra, Bennett adds his personal touch to each song. This is a tribute to the music, as well as to Sinatra","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d60d4962d1624c46dc318e944a4017386aca781","amp;dn":"Tony+Bennett+-+Perfectly+Frank+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d60d4962d1624c46dc318e944a4017386aca781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,96,212,150,45,22,36,196,109,195,24,233,68,164,1,115,134,172,167,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
