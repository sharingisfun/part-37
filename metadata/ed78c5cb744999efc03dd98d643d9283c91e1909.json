Including former members of Catacomb Gypsy Vagina &amp; Complicated Shirt, CGT wears its local indie scenester cred sardonically on its sleeve. Heralding influences like Polvo, Joy Division, and Fugazi (yet bearing no blatant resemblance to any of them), and playing volatile, pseudo-intellectual tunes about porn, bourgeois guilt, and cyborgs, Che Guevara T-shirt has been an instant relative success on the incestuously close-knit Albany indie-rock scene.\n\nWhite Fever is their 4th album.\n\nTrack List:\n01 Time.mp3\t9.91 MB\n02 Some Prick.mp3\t12.96 MB\n03 XX Steve.mp3\t8.06 MB\n04 The Wraith.mp3\t10.42 MB\n05 Early.mp3\t10.50 MB\n06 The Shuffle.mp3\t17.88 MB\n\nRecommended if you like Sonic Youth, Unwound, Polvo, Dianogah, Fugazi, Joy Division, etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed78c5cb744999efc03dd98d643d9283c91e1909","amp;dn":"Che+Guevara+T-Shirt+--+White+Fever+%282013%29+%28mp3+%40320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed78c5cb744999efc03dd98d643d9283c91e1909","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,120,197,203,116,73,153,239,192,61,217,141,100,61,146,131,201,30,25,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
