Written by Eisner-nominee BRAD GUIGAR (HOW TO MAKE WEBCOMICS, Evil Inc.) and illustrated by CHRIS GIARRUSSO (G-MAN, Mini Marvels), TALES FROM THE CON is an uproarious take on the world of comic books and conventions. Fanboys, fangirls, cosplayers, retailers, volunteers, and pros repeatedly collide on the convention floor (and beyond) to prove that comic conventions are one part festival, two parts group therapy. Collects the first year of TALES FROM THE CON strips along with bonus material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6fc2f592a53586aa34f2cc967bbaf10a4fffaf4","amp;dn":"Tales+From+the+Con+-+Year+001+%282014%29+%28Digital%29+%28DR+%26amp%3B+Quinch-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6fc2f592a53586aa34f2cc967bbaf10a4fffaf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,252,47,89,42,83,88,106,163,79,44,201,103,187,175,16,164,255,250,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
