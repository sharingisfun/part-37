During the Middle Ages these fortified structures were the ultimate authority in any region they were built. Both defensive and offensive, they were centres of administration, symbols of power as well as concentrations of military might. But what was it that made each successful? Through dynamic location footage and immersive visual effects, this six episode series reveals the bloody history behind these fortifications and the weapons designed to defeat them. Each episode will climax with the ultimate test of each castle's strength: examining the epic battle that changed the course of history.\n\n\n\n6)  Gibralfaro Castle \nLocated high above the Mediterranean coast, Gibralfaro Castle and its surrounding defences are the monuments of a Muslim dynasty. Its daunting towers, brilliant water-storage, and one-of-a-kind passageway were engineered to withstand the most ambitious attacker. In 1487, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella descend to capture the city and destroy the legacy it represents - but will their audacious plan win the day?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8581/battlecastlescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8581/battlecastlescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2460/battlecastlescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2460/battlecastlescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/9826/battlecastlescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/9826/battlecastlescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/23/battlecastlescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/23/battlecastlescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6648/battlecastlescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6648/battlecastlescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/989/battlecastlescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/989/battlecastlescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6854/battlecastlescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6854/battlecastlescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4091/battlecastlescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4091/battlecastlescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2690/battlecastlescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2690/battlecastlescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2092 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 44mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://battlecastle.tv/?meta=home#series&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://battlecastle.tv/?meta=home#series&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5295851e551d917f6ee95422c812829b5f0f53","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Battle+Castle+with+Dan+Snow+6of6+Gibralfaro+Castle+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5295851e551d917f6ee95422c812829b5f0f53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,82,149,133,30,85,29,145,127,110,233,84,34,200,18,130,155,95,15,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
