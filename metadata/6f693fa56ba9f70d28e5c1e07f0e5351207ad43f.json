The game displays colourful, whimsical design and a fast pace. It is available on Android, iOS and Windows Phone platforms. Players of the game take the role of youthful hooligans who, caught in the act of applying graffiti to a metro railway site, take off down the tracks to escape the inspector. As the hooligan avatars run they grab gold coins out of the air while simultaneously dodging collisions with railway cars and other objects.\nSubway Surfers launched in May 2012 with updates based on seasonal holidays. Since January 2013 updates have been based on a &quot;World Tour&quot; theme that places game action in a new city each month. Cities featured included New York City, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, Rome, Tokyo, Miami, Paris, Beijing, Moscow, New Orleans, London, and Mumbai.[1]\nOn 6th January 2014, developer Kiloo announced that the latest &quot;World Tour: Mumbai&quot; (v1.17) which was released after &quot;World Tour: London&quot;, will not be released on Windows Phone 8-powered devices.[2]\n\nTHIS game is modded to give you UNLIMITED MONEY AND KEYS!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.subwaysurf&amp;hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.subwaysurf&amp;hl=en&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDeveloper(s)\tKiloo\nPublisher(s)\tKiloo\nDistributor(s)\tKiloo\nPlatform(s)\tiOS, Android, Windows Phone 8 (1.16.1 version only)\nRelease date(s)\tMay 2012\nMode(s)\tSingle-player\nDistribution\tiTunes, Google Play, Amazon Appstore, Windows Phone Store","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f693fa56ba9f70d28e5c1e07f0e5351207ad43f","amp;dn":"SubwaySurfer+World+Tour+Moscow+1+1+4+%2A%2Amodded%2A%2A+unlimited+money+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f693fa56ba9f70d28e5c1e07f0e5351207ad43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,105,63,165,107,169,247,13,40,229,193,224,127,14,83,81,32,122,212,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
