The game has been devised by the developers from 19 mysterious files, sent to them by an unknown figure via email; they were asked to finish the project using the information stored in these files, with the only catch that they had to include everything in the files, but designing it was entirely up to them.\n\nThe aim of the game is to play what is essentially a game of hide and seek, but against unusual 'Guests' who have been visiting the house of a hermit - the player character. The aim of the game is to merely survive the night with your sanity intact. Once the night is over you need to plan for the night ahead, making repairs and changes to the house, and kitting yourself out with what you would need to survive.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the Knock-Knock (Easy Run).exe.exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb1256aa12fb65a63bfe9a71ca0b2a0e57642d8","amp;dn":"Knock-Knock+%28Easy+Run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb1256aa12fb65a63bfe9a71ca0b2a0e57642d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,177,37,106,161,47,182,90,99,191,233,167,28,160,178,160,229,118,66,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
