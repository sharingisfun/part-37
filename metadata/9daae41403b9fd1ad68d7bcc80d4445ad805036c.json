Players take on the persona of Asghan, a warrior prince who swears to avenge the death of his father by dragons. The game is praised for smooth integration of action and role-playing elements as well as a wide array of enemies and weapons. It suffers, however, from lacking character development and awkward controls.\n\n\nGame disc music is included as .mp3 under the folder - &quot;asghan music ripper&quot;\nNo-CD crack is included under - &quot;bb_asghan.zip&quot;\n\nThis game does work, but not on Win7(or anything newer than Win-XP)\nThe solution is to use a virtual machine with an older operating system installed(or just an old computer with WinXP will work)\n\n\n\n1- download VM-Ware player &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0&lt;/a&gt;\nIt's very user friendly.\n\n2- download some older windows OS(if you have a winXP disc in hand, then just use that). I prefer TinyXP since it uses very little resources. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5388565/Windows_Tiny_XP_Rev10-eXPerience&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5388565/Windows_Tiny_XP_Rev10-eXPerience&lt;/a&gt;\n\n3- Create a new virtual machine using VMWare-player, give it the tinxp.iso you download from above and follow installation instructions to get that onto your Virtual machine.\n\n4- Get Asghan onto the virtual machine. A USB flash-drive works easy, just copy asghan to the USB-stick, unplug the USB-stick. Click somewhere within the virtual machine and only then plug back the USB-stick into your physical computer. Now your tinyXP virtual machine should be able to see the USB-stick. Copy asghan from that onto virtual machine.\n\n5- Extract all the files from &quot;bb_asghan.zip&quot; to the main asghan folder(the one containing _start.exe). Replace all files with the cracked versions.\n\n6- Run _start.exe and enjoy!\n\n\n\n\nIf the game fails to run, tinker with compatibility settings of _start.exe\ntry using the original _start.exe (the uncracked version).\n\n...and if anyone gets this to work on Win7/8, let me know please","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9daae41403b9fd1ad68d7bcc80d4445ad805036c","amp;dn":"Asghan+The+dragon+slayer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9daae41403b9fd1ad68d7bcc80d4445ad805036c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,170,228,20,3,185,253,26,214,141,123,204,128,212,68,90,216,5,3,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
