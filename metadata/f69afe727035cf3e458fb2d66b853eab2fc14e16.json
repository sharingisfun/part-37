Female focused, all ages, mature, super heroes, and more type of readers! So many different types of comics included!\n\nWhat is included:\n-- Ongoings from Marvel, DC, Image, and others that have recently started, easily accessible for new readers, and the first story is already finished (EX: Animal Man ~ V1 The Hunt.... The folder has issues #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6 of the first story arc in Animal Man, The Hunt.)\n-- Recently Completed Mini Series from same companies (and some older ones) that fit the same critera as before.\n--Finished (some bit older) Ongoings that are Amazing (just great!) that everyone should read however also have the accessible focus!\n--Some of the best Digital comics I have read!\n--And some great Graphic Novels!\n\nBasically the point... Pick up the first volume (V1) of any title in the torrent and you should be very well prepared. For new readers, you don't need to know much or often anything at all of what has happened before (because in many cases the stories are in their own universe). And this also means this is also Great for Any Comic Book reader because it most likely includes titles you just haven't yet tried and this gives you the perfect chance!\n\nPlease leave any comments... suggestions... anything at all!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69afe727035cf3e458fb2d66b853eab2fc14e16","amp;dn":"Comic+Book+Starter+Kit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69afe727035cf3e458fb2d66b853eab2fc14e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,154,254,114,112,53,207,62,69,143,178,214,107,133,62,171,47,193,78,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
