A museum is a materialised history; there, with the historical relics on display, we have dialogues with history. As we have realised that a museum would be a useful tool for the publicity of a city, museums have become projects that architects and designers most long for. While appreciating the museums, readers would learn more about the distinguished concepts and the distinct features of them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42da9cfc87846f2b55d1e3dc1e3bcedc9000ade1","amp;dn":"Museums+Architecture+Design+%28English-Chinese+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42da9cfc87846f2b55d1e3dc1e3bcedc9000ade1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,218,156,252,135,132,111,43,85,209,227,220,30,59,206,220,144,0,173,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
