Who do you think it could be?\n\nOne thing is certain: there are plenty of surprises in store when My Kitchen Rules launches in 2013.\n\nManu Feildel and Pete Evans return to host and judge the ultimate home-cooking battle as they accept dinner party invites in each state across the country.\n\nThis series they welcome new guest judge Colin Fassnidge to the table alongside returning guest judges Guy Grossi, Karen Martini and Liz Egan.\n\nIt's state versus state, plate against plate, as teams of two attempt to out-dine and out-wine each other to see whose kitchen rules.\n\nEach team will take turns to transform an ordinary home into an instant restaurant for one pressure cooker night. They'll serve up a three course menu designed to impress not only their fellow contestants but our esteemed judges.\n\nThere will be triumphs, kitchen fires, laughter, tears and plenty of opinionated guests as they battle the clock and their nerves to plate up on time.\n\nThe top two teams will again battle it out in the grand final where they will present their ultimate dining menu to a full restaurant.\n\nWith $250,000 in prize money on offer, the knives will definitely be out.\n\nThe competition continues to sizzle tonight as the second group of finalists is decided. The winner from Monday's food truck challenge has chosen their two adversaries for tonight, and in a surprise twist they will also choose the ingredients that each team cooks with for the challenge.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9376d11735d492397c59f56e6fd1541b85cdfdc8","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.AU.S04E41.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9376d11735d492397c59f56e6fd1541b85cdfdc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,118,209,23,53,212,146,57,124,89,245,110,111,209,84,27,133,205,253,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
