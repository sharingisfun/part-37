I have made every effort to ensure historical accuracy for this new period, however, if you notice anything wrong please do not hesitate to leave a comment. \n\nWhat you'll see: \n\n-A new start date of 25th December 1356 \n-New bookmarks: The Grand Campaign, The Queen in the North, The Ottoman Interregnum and The Treaty of Troyes. \n-A (hopefully) historically world Map \n-New countries and historical leaders for the period. \n-5 New tech levels, levels 6-13 of the Tech system overhauled, plus tweaked dates for all technologies to minimise Monarch Point waste. \n-Many fixed Vanilla History Files (countries, provinces, diplomacy, etc.) for the entire game period. \n-New Religions \n-Multiple event chains, including the Hussite Revolution and the forming of the Kalmar Union. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7007cb2635a28123391dfe05bee219ae54bb0cd2","amp;dn":"1356+-+A+Timeline+Extension+Mod+for+EUIV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7007cb2635a28123391dfe05bee219ae54bb0cd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,7,203,38,53,162,129,35,57,29,254,5,190,226,25,174,84,187,12,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
