This ship boasts 13 decks the size of 11 football fields to accommodate her wheeled cargo - big or small - without leaving a single scratch or a dent.\n\nNot only is her capacity impressive, but every inch of Faust is designed to make her one of the most environmentally-friendly ships afloat. And with state-of-the-art technology throughout, she's so fully automated she hardly needs a crew.\n\nBut a winter crossing of the North Atlantic requires more than high-tech instrumentation to dodge rough waves and gale force winds directly in her path. Watch as this trip puts every one of her 22-member crew to the test.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e69bc472f358c62a2a3942bc9658689ced25f2","amp;dn":"Discovery.Mighty.Ships.Faust.x264.720p.AC3.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74e69bc472f358c62a2a3942bc9658689ced25f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,230,155,196,114,243,88,198,42,42,57,66,188,150,88,104,156,237,37,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
