(CRC, 2002).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781482263138\r\n\r\nThe unexpected recent discovery and synthesis of a new form of elemental carbon has initiated an abundance of papers on all aspects of the chemistry and physics of the carbon family. Carbon Molecules and Materials takes stock of the current understanding of these various solid forms and, more particularly, of the diamond, graphite and fullerenes. After a historical background on the main properties of the element and on the latest discoveries in the field of fullerene, the chapters review the chemical and physical aspects of the allotropic forms. It describes the various properties such as thermodynamic, chemical, structural, electronic, electrical, optical and magnetic, and discusses current and potential applications.\r\n\r\nWritten by scientists active in physical and chemical research on the various forms of carbon and closely related fields, the book presents a wealth of information on data and results for students and researchers interested in materials science and in the applications of advanced materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77f8fefccab1e6c2258396a22cab2ef1e6d5325","amp;dn":"Carbon+Molecules+and+Materials+-+Ralph+Setton+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77f8fefccab1e6c2258396a22cab2ef1e6d5325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,127,143,239,204,171,30,108,34,88,57,106,34,202,178,239,30,109,83,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
