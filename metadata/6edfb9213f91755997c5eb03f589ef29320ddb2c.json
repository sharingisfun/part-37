Though based in Paris, their musical family tree extends to New York City, Sweden, Berlin and the UK. TheyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹ve recorded a dozen Peel Sessions on the BBC and have already shared the stage with Arcade Fire, Kimya Dawson, Of Montreal, Jeffrey Lewis and The Kooks.\n\nThe &quot;I Wish That I Could See You Soon&quot; EP is Herman DuneÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹s first Everloving release. An infectious burst of beautiful pop sounds, the music owes as much to the wry wit of Jonathan Richman as it does to Chuck Berry&amp;#039;s classic guitar clang. With bourbon horns n&amp;#039; brass and girl-group vocals courtesy of The Woo-Woo&amp;#039;s (Lisa Li Lund and the New York Babyskins), the songs are warm, sunny and borderline Spector-esque. Rolling Stone named &quot;I Wish That I Could See You Soon&quot; as one of the best 100 songs of 2007.\n\nTheir 2nd ep for Everloving is ÃƒÂ¢??1-2-3 Apple Tree.ÃƒÂ¢?? You may have seen the video, featuring the raisin stealing Kramer from SeinfeldÃƒÂ¢??s breakthrough season 4ÃƒÂ¢??s ÃƒÂ¢??The PilotÃƒÂ¢?? episode. Everloving will release a new full length album September 08.\n\nmore Everloving releases at everloving.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6edfb9213f91755997c5eb03f589ef29320ddb2c","amp;dn":"Herman+Dune+-+I+Wish+That+I+Could+See+You+Soon+video+%28iPod+Ready","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6edfb9213f91755997c5eb03f589ef29320ddb2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,223,185,33,63,145,117,89,151,197,235,3,245,137,239,41,50,13,219,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
