Written by the amazing Jim Starlin, the story focuses on the psychological manipulation of Batman as he is force to undergo brainwashing at the hands of the titular cult, and how they come to gain power as they rise from the underground. Brutal and effective, it is one of the earliest of examples of the mental breakdown of Bruce Wayne which has become a common them in the decades since (most notably in Grant Morrison's run, among others). Also, parts of this story can clearly be seen as an influence on The Dark Knight Rises. Thanks again to Empire for the rips, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ac19b1b8f9337009d201771b2e121d421a7485","amp;dn":"Batman+-+The+Cult+%281988%2C+Digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ac19b1b8f9337009d201771b2e121d421a7485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,172,25,177,184,249,51,112,9,210,1,119,27,46,18,29,66,26,116,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
