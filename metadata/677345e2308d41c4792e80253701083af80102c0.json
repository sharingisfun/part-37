Another gem from Mali.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP\nThe Quality Music Project\n\nGuitarist Lobi TraorÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ plays deep blues from his homeland in Mali, east of that other River of Song -- the Niger. He is not as famous as the late Ali Farka Toure, his countryman and grand influence on much of Mali's music (and who actually produced TraorÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹'s 1994 set, Bamako, named for the country's capitol). TraorÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ was the guitarist on Damon Albarn's Mali Music recording that kicked off the Honest Jons label that this recording is released on. The blurb on this boasts a BBC review that positions TraorÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ somewhere between Jimmy Page and John Lee Hooker. Forget it. TraorÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹'s guitar playing is utterly electric, gritty, funky, and knotty. His style is raw but extremely sophisticated. Check out the opener, &quot;Jugu,&quot; with its killer polyrhythms and TraorÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹'s throaty baritone spitting out the lyrics. His fills cover the breadth and depth of the rhythm section's furious playing. The distortion has nothing to do with sound effects, man -- he's playing it at ten! The following cut, &quot;Deni Kelen Be Koko,&quot; feels a lot like something that should be on Fat Possum if they did a field recording in Mali. There is so much here that is steaming, tough, and wiry. This is the best blues record of early 2006 and it isn't even a blues record. It's hard Malian folk music gone electric, and full of the most killer singing, dancing, and yes, guitar playing out there.\n-- allmusic.com\n\nTracks\n01- Jugu\n02- Deni Kelen Be Koko\n03- Kassi Ma Sumaya\n04- Baba Kansay Kagni\n05- Yo Ya Yo\n06- Koro Duga Mele Bila\n07- Son Tani Gnini\n08- Bari Bola Mini De\n09- Juguya Magni\n10- Dana Mogo\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan), EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:677345e2308d41c4792e80253701083af80102c0","amp;dn":"Lobi+Traore+-+The+Lobi+Traore+Group+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"677345e2308d41c4792e80253701083af80102c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,115,69,226,48,141,65,196,121,46,128,37,55,1,8,58,248,1,2,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
