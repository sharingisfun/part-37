Abstergo, the modern-day Knights Templar, had been using Desmond to locate powerful out-of-place artifacts called &quot;Pieces of Eden.&quot; Using the &quot;Eagle Vision&quot; ability he gained as a result of the &quot;bleeding effect&quot; (from overexposure to the Animus), Desmond is able to see messages and symbols written in blood on his bedroom wall, written by the former test subject, named &quot;Subject 16 (Cam Clarke)&quot;. Lucy Stillman (Kristen Bell), a former researcher for Abstergo and an Assassin, frees Desmond and brings him to a secret hideout used by herself and two other Assassins, historian Shaun Hastings (Danny Wallace) and computer expert Rebecca Crane (Eliza Schneider). With their own version of the Animus, dubbed the 'Animus 2.0', they invite Desmond to help them discover the memories of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, for two reasons: to train Desmond in Assassin skills through the bleeding effect, and to find other Pieces of Eden.\n\nEzio, residing in Italy during the Renaissance in the late 15th century, finds his family in Florence the victims of a political plot, and is unable to prevent the hanging of his father and two brothers. His father's final instructions lead Ezio to a chest containing Assassin garments and tools. Ezio's uncle Mario allows Ezio and his mother and sister to shelter in his countryside villa, and trains Ezio in the art of combat. Mario further provides leads to those in on his family's betrayal, and Ezio follows the trail of clues, leading from Florence to San Gimignano, ForlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬, Venice and eventually to Rome. Along the way, he encounters several allies that assist in his pursuit, including Leonardo da Vinci, who is able to help decode pages from AltaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯r's Codex, creating new equipment. After assassinating many people involved in the plot, Ezio is able to identify Rodrigo Borgia as the leader of the conspiracy, aimed to bring down the Medici family and the Doge of Venice. Borgia later arrives in Venice with the &quot;Apple,&quot; the Piece of Eden that AltaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯r originally had found. Borgia believes himself to be the &quot;Prophet&quot; that would lead to the discovery of &quot;The Vault&quot;, supposedly containing more Pieces of Eden and other knowledge the Templars seek. Ezio, joined by his allies, stop Borgia, who flees without the Apple. His allies, including NiccolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² Machiavelli, reveal they are all members of the Assassins, and bring Ezio into their ranks, telling him that they believe him to be the Prophet that will lead them to the Vault.\n\n\n\nMinimum Configurations:\n=======================\n\nSUPPORTED OS: WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP (32-64 bits) /Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®(32-64 bits) /Windows 7Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® (32-64 bits) \nProcessor: Intel CoreÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2 Duo 1.8 GHZ or AMD Athlon X2 64 2.4GHZ\nRAM: 1.5 GBÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP / 2 GB Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® - Windows 7Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®\nVideo Card: 256 MB DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  9.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher (see supported list)\nSound Card: DirectX 9.0 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant sound card \nDirectX Version: DirectX 9.0 \nDVD-ROM: DVD-ROM dual-layer drive\nHard Drive Space: 8 GB\nPeripherals Supported: Keyboard, mouse, optional controller\n\n\n* This product does not support WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 98/ME/2000/NT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1010385f8a3c8878601d43b9b15781dec3ff78","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+ASSASSIN%C3%82%C2%B4S+CREED+2+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1010385f8a3c8878601d43b9b15781dec3ff78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,16,16,56,95,138,60,136,120,96,29,67,185,177,87,129,222,195,255,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
