Underground were the best, a flamboyantly-attired, multi-racial show band in the Family Stone mould, whose covers of Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield and Santana tingle with the excitement of escape from military drudgery. Sadly, only one member of the four bands has since been traced Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for potentially more tragic reasons than usual.\n\nThis compilation produced by Eothen Ã¢â‚¬Å“EgonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alapatt and David Hollander.\nOriginal East of Underground and SOAP sessions produced by Ted Spencer.\nOriginal The Black Seeds and The Sound Trek sessions produced by Larry Rowe.\n\nArt direction by Errol Richardson.\nRestoration and remastering by Dave Cooley.\n\nLiner notes by David Hollander and Sam Lipsyte.\nProject coordination by Henoch Moore.\n\nEast of Underground:\n\nHigher\nSmiling Faces\nHell Below\nPeople Get Ready\nGetting Over\nBetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ya Never Lose My Love/California Dreamer\nI Love You\nJava Girl\nWalk On By\n\nSOAP:\n\nI Just Want To Celebrate\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Got A Friend\nSouthern Man\nMedley: Will The Circle Be Unbroken/I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Know How To Love Him\nTicket To Ride\nI Feel The Earth Move\nUncle Albert\nGypsies, Tramps and Thieves\nNever My Love\nWalk Away\nGet Together\n\nThe Black Seeds/The Sound Trek:\n\nGo Outside in the Rain\nAinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t No Sunshine\nBlack Magic Woman\nDo Your Thing\nBackstabbers\nIntro Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kool and the Gang\nWalking in the Rain\nBackstabbers\nColdest Day of my Life\nIf Loving You is Wrong\nI Love Everything About You\n\n3CD Box Set, 3LP Box Set. 2011.
