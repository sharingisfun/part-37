With the whole nation watching, he is just \none question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; \nBut when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid \nknow so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and \nhis brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and \nof Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of \nthe game show's questions. Each chapter of Jamal's increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the \nanswers to the show's seemingly impossible quizzes. But one question remains a mystery: what is this young \nman with no apparent desire for riches really doing on the game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal \nreturns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out. At \nthe heart of its storytelling lies the question of how anyone comes to know the things they know about \nlife and love.\n\nCast : \nDev Patel ... Jamal Malik\nAnil Kapoor ...
