Some people questioned whether there was more hype than hits, but from the moment Lana glided on to the stage she had the audience eating out of her hand. Backed by a guitarist, 3 string players, an immaculate white grand piano and decked out in a white veil + wedding dress combo - Lana had no trouble turning her crowd to mush. In fact, she spent at least a third of the set in the pit in front of the stage surrounded by adoring fans who sang along to every line of her Born To Die cuts. Enjoy the luscious sounds of 'Blue Jeans' and a breathtaking version of 'Video Games', the song that scored her the #6 spot in the Hottest 100 of 2011, and a cover of the Nirvana classic 'Heart Shaped Box'.\n\n\n\nVenue: \nSplendour In The Grass, Byron - Australia\n\nRecorded: \n28/07/2012\n\nFirst Broadcast: \n03/09/2012\n\n\nSetlist:\n\n\nBlue Jeans\nBody Electric\nBorn To Die\nSummertime Sadness\nWithout You\nMillion Dollar Man\nHeart Shaped Box (Nirvana cover)\nCarmen\nVideo Games\nRadio\nNational Anthem\n\nPlus:\n\nPost Concert Interview\n\n\nRecorded in full WAV quality.\n\nDownload and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:977479c9972190984000ceb14c152106d6dc1096","amp;dn":"Lana+Del+Rey+-+Triple+J+-+Live+At+The+Wireless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"977479c9972190984000ceb14c152106d6dc1096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,116,121,201,151,33,144,152,64,0,206,177,76,21,33,6,214,220,16,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
