By now, the Chili Peppers shed guitarists like a second skin, changing their outer layer but retaining their inner core. Such is the case with IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m with You, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album since 2006Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Stadium Arcadium. If that double-disc was defined by its unwieldy sprawl, its songs spewed not sequenced, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m with You is characterized by its focus, both within individual tunes and the songs as a whole. New guitarist Josh Klinghoffer -- veteran sideman and longtime pal of Frusciante who provided secondary guitar on the closing stretch of the Stadium Arcadium tour -- doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t compete for center stage the way previous Peppers did. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t strut, he weaves, disappearing so completely into the arrangements he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to leave his signature despite the heavy layers of guitars on each cut. This makes IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m with You the flipside of One Hot Minute, where the Chili Peppers bent over backward to accommodate Dave Navarro: the Peppers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss a step, they almost seem relieved to be carrying on without Frusciante. Part of that could be due to a newfound musical elasticity, a reflection of Flea taking music theory classes at USC during the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s half-decade gap between albums. Certainly a song like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happiness Loves CompanyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- half Beach Boys, half Kinks -- shows a compositional dexterity unthinkable for previous incarnations of the Peppers, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no showiness here, the album is all about precision. This extends to Anthony Kiedis, who neither hams it up on the ballads nor goofs around on his raps, he merely serves the purposes of the song like the old pro he now is. Ultimately, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are served well by that professionalism; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re long past the point of proving themselves, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re no longer here for a party, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re rock &amp; roll lifers, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m with You illustrates they can settle into maturity convincingly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86e92c9a7b91a416b73e72a177684823fc9f6094","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+-+I%27m+with+You+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86e92c9a7b91a416b73e72a177684823fc9f6094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,233,44,154,123,145,164,22,183,62,114,161,119,104,72,35,252,159,96,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
