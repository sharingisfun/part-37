The trident had pierced through her. And the snow-white gown was turning ever more crimson.&quot;\n\nFour years ago, while vacationing at their country estate in Scotland, Jon Stuart watched his wife plummet from the balcony to a horrific death. Although cleared of any involvement, he's endured years of public suspicion--losing friends and his good standing in the community. But this was no accident, and now he's determined to prove it was murder.\n\nOrchestrating a dangerous plan, Jon has gathered the prime suspects at the scene of the crime. The stage is set as past and present collide, old lovers reunite...and a killer plots another perfect crime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9fdad783dee4e19531694555be0317c096e4fb5","amp;dn":"Heather+Graham+-+Never+Sleep+With+Strangers+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9fdad783dee4e19531694555be0317c096e4fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,253,173,120,61,238,78,25,83,22,148,85,91,224,49,124,9,110,79,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
