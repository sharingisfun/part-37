For over four decades, they have changed modern music as we know it. But some of their most famous performances have never been released... until now.\n\nOn December 15, 1977, The Who performed before a select invited audience at the Gaumont State Theatre in Kilburn, North London, to record a concert for Jeff Stein's film, The Kids Are Alright, which turned out to be one of the last live performances by drummer Keith Moon. Shot in 35mm, this holy grail for fans has been digitally restored and remastered in high-definitiion for the ultimate The Who experience. This set also includes The Who's powerhouse London Coliseum gig from 1969, a never-before-seen rarity and one of the band's personal favorites.\n\nTrack list:\n\n01 - I Can't Explain 03:10\n02 - Subsitute 03:00\n03 - Baba O'riley 05:19\n04 - My Wife 07:03\n05 - Behind Blue Eyes 03:34\n06 - Dreaming From The Waist 05:11\n07 - Pinball Wizard 02:44\n08 - I'm Free 02:46\n09 - Tommy's Holiday Camp 01:31\n10 - Summertime Blues 03:46\n11 - Shakin' All Over 05:01\n12 - My Generation 03:45\n13 - Join Together 02:28\n14 - Who Are You 06:05\n15 - Won't Get Fooled Again 08:50\n16 - Outro/credits 01:34\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1372bfdb338b2de54c81089d6c8e3ea3ffa3b59","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Live+Kilburn+%28London%2C+UK+1977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1372bfdb338b2de54c81089d6c8e3ea3ffa3b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,55,43,253,179,56,178,222,84,200,16,137,214,200,227,234,63,250,59,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
