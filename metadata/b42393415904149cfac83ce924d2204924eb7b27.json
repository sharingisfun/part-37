With the crew nearing bankruptcy, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hired to get to the bottom of a series of spooky events at the remote Kyser mansion, an old religious school plagued by rumors of satanism and ritualistic murder. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re experts at debunking ghost stories, so they get right to work, and despite the ominous signs that this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just another greedy land-developer or bitter landlord, they set up to stay the night. When the sun goes down, the truth comes out: this place might actually be hauntedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦by sadistic spirits or something much, much deadlier.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321501/\nRelease Date: 16 June 2012 (USA)\nGenre: Horror\nStars : Jory Balsimo, Rebecca Beegle, Andrew Bujalski\nQuality: 720p WEB-DL\nEncoder: SHQ@Ganool\nSource: 720p WEB-DL DD5.1 H264-PHD\nSize: 650MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b42393415904149cfac83ce924d2204924eb7b27","amp;dn":"Saturday+Morning+Mystery+%282012%29+720p+WEB-DL+650MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b42393415904149cfac83ce924d2204924eb7b27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,35,147,65,89,4,20,156,250,200,60,233,36,210,32,73,36,235,123,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
