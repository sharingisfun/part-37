However, users should keep in mind that AVAST! Pro Anti-Virus is ad-supported, so it offers to install additional utilities that it does not actualy need to work properly. They can be avoided with a little attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntuitive UI and multiple scanning modes with customized settings\r\n\r\nThe tool is wrapped in a pleasant and organized interface, where all components are neatly organized. Different types of scanning methods are available for users, depending on their preferences. They have optimized settings and can be altered in terms of types of scanned objects, heuristics, potentially unwanted files (PUP's) and other suspicious items, generating reports, excluding files and folders marked as trusted, automatic course of action once threats are identified (or prompt for action), and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtra security measures to ensure online safety\r\n\r\nApart from the previously mentioned SafeZone feature, Pro contains SecureLine to ensure data privacy via VPN, a Sandbox to run suspicious applications confined in a secured virtual environment without doing any reral damage to the computer, along with a rescue mode to boot Windows in case it becomes unresponsive due to heavy malware attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance and conclusion\r\n\r\nUsers may either favor scanning speed or machine resources consumption by adjusting AVAST!'S Priority Level. The components can be easily enabled and disabled with just a click of the mouse, as well as tweaked in detail by advanced users. Concerning malware detection ratio, AVAST! Pro Anti-Virus delivers very good results. It is frequently a favorite choice among the user community, so it's definitely worth taking it for a spin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's new in AVAST! 2016 (Release date: 2016-11-01):\r\n\r\nNEW: Passwords - AVAST! can now manage your passwords and generate strong passwords for you.
