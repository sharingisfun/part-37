Having got a yen for sparser songs out of his system with last year's solo album, he's returned with a zeal for large-scale emotion, and Walk the River is laden with it. It abounds in dramatic word-pictures, possibly pertaining to the end of the romance with the woman who inspired his solo LP (&quot;Walk the river like a hunted animal&quot;, &quot;When I see it I hear crashing drums&quot;) and sky-high choruses, arranged into some of the most sumptuous songs Guillemots have ever created. This is a group who don't believe in understatement, so there's a lot going on, from the fuzzy guitar and spacey synth squeaks that take The Basket in a psychedelic direction to Tiger's girl-group harmonies, but none of it feels superfluous Ã¢â‚¬â€œ every sound here contributes to a big, beautiful whole.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ef62439da9c12a009e13a3f4982a63873cae94b","amp;dn":"Guillemots...Walk+the+River%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ef62439da9c12a009e13a3f4982a63873cae94b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,246,36,57,218,156,18,160,9,225,58,63,73,130,166,56,115,202,233,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
