Join the &quot;more brave than brilliant&quot; aviatrix Rita James on another whirlwind adventure, this time in search of the mythical paradise of Shangri La! Travel with Rita, Sebastian, Dr. James, and Marbles--the one-eyed monkey--to a land of mystery where few have ventured. Escape a small mining village filled with murderous thugs; traverse steep Himalayan passes rumored to be guarded by a hideous Yeti; and all the while, escape the sinister Dr. Stroheim--who is only driven by greed and revenge! Can you save Shangri La before this paradise is lost? This light-hearted, yet thrilling storyline is pays homage to the 1930s adventure serials.\n\n\nextract and play \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c1bdd5b9acb4418b980beb099f63b7ba0230711","amp;dn":"Rita+James+and+the+Race+to+Shangri+La","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c1bdd5b9acb4418b980beb099f63b7ba0230711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,27,221,91,154,203,68,24,185,128,190,176,153,246,59,123,160,35,7,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
