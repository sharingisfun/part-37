Break On Me will be his 20th number 1 single should it reach the top.  Rascal Flatts also enter the countdown with I Like The Sound Of That, while Old Dominion score their first chart topper in Break Up With Him.\r\n\r\nWith the busy holiday season coming up Iâ€™m considering ending these Top 30 U.S. Country torrents, as they are time consuming, cost me money to purchase and other torrents exist with the same content.  Let me know if you would like them to continue or the Nov 24 torrent will be my last upload.  \r\n\r\nHere are the U.S. Country Top 30 singles according to Mediabase in mp3 320 Stereo CBR.
