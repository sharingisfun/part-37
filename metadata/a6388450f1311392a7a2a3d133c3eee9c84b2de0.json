Whether in the early, volume-centric days of Earth or the pristine blues crawl of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reboot, CarlsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s steady approach to the guitar has suggested careful reflection and deliberate decisions. But heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an incredibly busy year ahead, with several reissues of vintage Earth LPs, a new album under the solo guise Drcarlsonalbion, another Earth record, and Gold, CarlsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 24-piece entry into the world of soundtracks.\n\nComposed for a Western about settlers of the Canadian west, Gold finds Carlson letting his riffs disintegrate into tiny clouds of noise and tone, disrupted by occasional percussion. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gold IÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which opens the collection, begins much like latter-day Earth, Carlson pristinely picking the lead against tinkling cymbals. But nothing else arrives. Instead, he wrestles with the theme alone, bending the notes but occasionally letting them bend back on him, shaping webs of distortion that hover like presiding anxiety. He sits pretty still, after all.\n\n\nAll songs in mp3 320kbits/s.\n\nTracklist:\n\nGold I - XXIV\n\nEnjoy, seed and support the band!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.drcarlsonalbion.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.drcarlsonalbion.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6388450f1311392a7a2a3d133c3eee9c84b2de0","amp;dn":"Drcarlsonalbion+-+Gold+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6388450f1311392a7a2a3d133c3eee9c84b2de0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,56,132,80,241,49,19,146,167,162,163,209,51,195,238,233,200,75,45,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
