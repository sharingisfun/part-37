This is due primarily to the inevitable increase in the distance among circuit elements and interconnect design solutions have become the greatest determining factor in overall performance.\n\nThree-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs), which contain multiple layers of active devices, have the potential to enhance dramatically chip performance and functionality, while reducing the distance among devices on a chip. They promise solutions to the current &quot;interconnect bottleneck&quot; challenges faced by IC designers. They also may facilitate the integration of heterogeneous materials, devices, and signals. However, before these advantages can be realized, key technology challenges of 3D ICs must be addressed.\n\nThis is the first book on 3-D integrated circuit design, covering all of the technological and design aspects of this emerging design paradigm, while proposing effective solutions to specific challenging problems concerning the design of three-dimensional integrated circuits. A handy, comprehensive reference or a practical design guide, this book provides a sound foundation for the design of three-dimensional integrated circuits.\n\n\n\n\n* Demonstrates how to overcome &quot;Interconnect Bottleneck&quot; with 3D Integrated Circuit Design...leading edge design techniques offer solutions to problems (performance/power consumption/price) faced by all circuit designers.\n* The FIRST book on 3D Integrated Circuit Design...provides up-to-date information that is otherwise difficult to find;\n* Focuses on design issues key to the product development cyle...good design plays a major role in exploiting the implementation flexibilities offered in the third dimension;\n* Provides broad coverage of 3D IC Design, including Interconnect Prediction Models, Thermal Management Techniques, and Timing Optimization...offers practical view of designing 3D circuits.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nVasilis F. Pavlidis received the B.S. and M.Eng. in electrical and computer engineering from the Democritus University of Thrace, Xanthi, Greece, in 2000 and 2002, respectively. He received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY in 2003 and 2008, respectively. From 2000 to 2002, he was with INTRACOM S.A., Athens, Greece. In summer of 2007, he was with Synopsys Inc., Mountain View, California. His current research interests are in the area of interconnect modeling, 3-D integration, networks-on-chip, and related design issues in VLSI.\n\nEby G. Friedman received the B.S. degree from Lafayette College in 1979, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Irvine, in 1981 and 1989, respectively, all in electrical engineering. From 1979 to 1991, he was with Hughes Aircraft Company, rising to the position of manager of the Signal Processing Design and Test Department, responsible for the design and test of high performance digital and analog IC's. He has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Rochester since 1991, where he is a Distinguished Professor, the Director of the High Performance VLSI/IC Design and Analysis Laboratory, and the Director of the Center for Electronic Imaging Systems. He is also a Visiting Professor at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. His current research and teaching interests are in high performance synchronous digital and mixed-signal microelectronic design and analysis with application to high speed portable processors and low power wireless communications. He is the author of more than 300 papers and book chapters, several patents, and the author or editor of ten books in the fields of high speed and low power CMOS design techniques, high speed interconnect, and the theory and application of synchronous clock and power distribution networks. He was the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems, a Member of the editorial board of the Proceedings of the IEEE and a recipient of the University of Rochester Graduate Teaching Award, and a College of Engineering Teaching Excellence Award. Dr. Friedman is a Senior Fulbright Fellow and an IEEE Fellow.\n\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 336 pages\n    * Publisher: Morgan Kaufmann (October 9, 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0123743435\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0123743435","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:111bbd6974522daec0a898b2221aa39bd0c10e5e","amp;dn":"Three+Dimensional+Integrated+Circuit+Design%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"111bbd6974522daec0a898b2221aa39bd0c10e5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,27,189,105,116,82,45,174,192,168,152,178,34,26,163,155,208,193,14,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
