But finding a kid who's been missing for a long time takes priority over her personal preferences. And if anyone can locate the child, Marc can -- even with his injury. So she'll overlook his attitude.\n\nAs they follow cold leads together, Courtney glimpses beneath his tough exterior to something surprising -- caring, compassionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦vulnerability. That softer side proves more irresistible than his good looks. An unexpected -- and unexpectedly intense -- attraction flares between them, making her wonder why she never saw this before. Suddenly the man she was determined to avoid is the only man she wants close!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:165bf2298b3f50db9b70c6b96dd14d290b588a88","amp;dn":"Jeanie+London+-+Love+in+Plain+Sight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"165bf2298b3f50db9b70c6b96dd14d290b588a88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,91,242,41,139,63,80,219,155,112,198,185,109,209,77,41,11,88,138,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
