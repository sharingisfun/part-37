Moore interviews a number of people who have been left broke by medical bills even though they were fully insured, and explains how the corporate drive for profits has left numerous people in financial and medical disarray. After hearing that detainees in Guantanamo have access to free health care, Moore assembles a group of World Trade Center rescue workers to travel to Cuba in order to get the medical help they need for ailments they incurred in 2001. Moore&amp;#039;s film debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide\n\n\n\nTheatrical Feature \nRunning Time: 123 mins \n\nComplete Cast: Michael Moore\n\n\nDirector(s):Michael Moore\nWriter(s):Michael Moore\nProducer(s):Michael Moore, Meghan O&amp;#039;Hara\nTheatrical MPAA Rating: PG13(Profanity)\nCategories:Documentary, Special InterestClosed Captioning:Check All Versions\nSubtitles:Check All Versions\nAwards:\n2007 - Sicko - Chicago Film Critics Association - Best Documentary\n2007 - Sicko - Las Vegas Film Critics - Best Documentary\n2007 - Sicko - New York Film Critics Online - Best Documentary\n2007 - Sicko - Phoenix Film Critics - Best Documentary\n2007 - Sicko - St. Louis Gateway Film Critics - Best Documentary\n2007 - Sicko - Washington D.C.
