This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThe act with the shortest name ever to debut a song in the countdown is at number 39.\n\nCasey tells about the act that received 11 gold records in a single calendar year, more than any other act including The Beatles, Elvis, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, or The Beach Boys.\n\nA listener wants to know if there has ever been a time when a former member of a group pushed another former member of a group out of the number one position. Casey says in the history of the charts it has happened only once and tells the story (and both songs were about love).\n\nCasey tells how Daryl Dragon and Toni Tennille of The Captain &amp; Tennille got married on Valentine's Day in a Nevada saloon with a couple of bombed-out boozers as witnesses.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What artist in the rock era has spent the most weeks in the top ten?&quot; Casey says the superstar who earned that honor did it by keeping a hit in the top ten every week for 52 consecutive weeks (and says it would have been 72 weeks except he dropped out of the top ten for one week).\n\nAnother listener asks this question: &quot;What was the biggest hit by a successful artist who used a different name on that hit?&quot; Casey says the song in question is now a Christmas classic.\n\n40:    Spring Rain - Silvetti\n39:    Magical Mystery Tour - Ambrosia\n38:    Dancing Man - Q        \n37:    Sometimes - Facts Of Life     \n36:    Love In 'C' Minor Part 1 - Cerrone     \n35:    Angel In Your Arms - Hot    \n34:    Night Moves - Bob Seger\n33:    Torn Between Two Lovers - Mary MacGregor\n32:    N.Y.
