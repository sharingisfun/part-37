Split into three themes, &quot;Swinging Times,&quot; &quot;Mellow Moods,&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Sounds,&quot; Songs of My Life relies heavily on the English pop sensation's peak '60s and '70s output. All of the key radio hits are here (&quot;Downtown,&quot; &quot;I Know a Place,&quot; &quot;My Love,&quot; &quot;This Is My Song&quot;), as well as countless ballads, uptempo pop gems, and choice covers. Fans looking for a decent career overview (sadly, none of Clark's vast arsenal of French hits are here) may find the 78 tracks that populate Songs of My Life a bit overwhelming, but they're well worth spending some quality time alone with.\nAll Music Review by James Christopher Monger\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] I Know A Place\n[02] I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\n[03] A Groovy Kind Of Love\n[04] I Can't Remember (Ever Loving You)\n[05] The Thirty First Of June\n[06] Tell Me (That It's Love)\n[07] Don't Sleep In The Subway\n[08] Colour My World\n[09] City Lights\n[10] Downtown\n[11] Have Another Dream On Me\n[12] The Sun Shines Out Of Your Shoes\n[13] Games People Play\n[14] Heart\n[15] You're The One\n[16] Fancy Dancin' Man\n[17] Time For Love\n[18] The World Song\n[19] I Want To Sing With Your Band\n[20] American Boys\n[21] The Sound Of Love\n[22] A Sign Of The Times\n[23] Round Every Corner\n[24] My Love\n[25] San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair)\n[26] Un Giorno Mi Hai Sorriso\n[27] The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener\n[28] Call Me\n\nPlay Time - 01h:18m:40s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] This Is My Song\n[02] I Will Wait For You\n[03] Imagine\n[04] This Is Goodbye\n[05] Smile\n[06] Eternally\n[07] Let It Be Me\n[08] Kiss Me Goodbye\n[09] Here Comes The Morning\n[10] Why Can't I Cry\n[11] How Insensitive\n[12] The Song Of My Life\n[13] Ceux Qui Ont Un Coeur\n[14] Jack And John\n[15] If\n[16] Song Went Wrong\n[17] Here, There And Everywhere\n[18] Forgetting You\n[19] Have I The Right\n[20] I Want To Hold Your Hand\n[21] Happy Heart\n[22] Too Late\n[23] For Love\n[24] Darling Verzeih'\n[25] Where Did We Go Wrong\n\nPlay Time - 01h:11m:05s\n\nCD03 Track Listings\n\n[01] The Wind Of Change\n[02] I Don't Know How To Love Him\n[03] There Goes My Love, There Goes My Life\n[04] Just Say Goodbye\n[05] I'm Begging You (Take Me Home Again)\n[06] Comme Une Priere\n[07] You'd Better Come Home\n[08] Love Is A Long Journey\n[09] Conversations In The Wind\n[10] Cranes Flying South\n[11] Hey Jude\n[12] I Know What Love Is About\n[13] Beautiful Sounds\n[14] Maybe I'm Amazed\n[15] Fool On The Hill\n[16] If Ever You're Lonely\n[17] Love Me With All Your Heart\n[18] I (Who Have Nothing)\n[19] Invece No\n[20] In Love\n[21] What I Did For Love\n[22] I Believe In Love\n[23] People Get Ready\n[24] The Windmills Of Your Mind\n[25] The Show Is Over\n\nPlay Time - 01h:19m:35s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 03h:49m:24s\nTotal File Size....................... 1.46GBs (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
